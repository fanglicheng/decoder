( international ) u.s. service still lags behind manufacturing in growth 
according to the ism standards , any reading above 50 in the service index means the industry is expanding , while any reading below 50 means the industry is declining . 
according to another ism report released on the 2 nd of this month , the u.s. manufacturing index soared in december to the highest point in 20 years . 
this shows that at present , the u.s. service growth still lags behind manufacturing growth . 
while manufacturing growth helps to increase employment and promote economic growth , service growth plays an even greater role in reducing unemployment and boosting economic growth . 
south asia summit ends with hope of thaw in india @-@ pakistan ties 
ms. zia , the bangladeshi prime minister , pointed out at the concluding session of the 12 th summit of south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) : " this summit marks a key watershed in enhancing south asian regional cooperation . " 
yesterday at a place close to the site of the summit , indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf held the first talk since a nuclear war nearly broke out between the two countries in 2002 . 
as rivalry between the two big powers of the saarc has hindered the development of the region , all leaders of the participating countries are greatly encouraged at the peace move obviously brought by this historic meeting between india and pakistan . 
pakistani military analyst masood told afp : " i think there is a definite change in the two countries ' positions . both are moving towards a peace process . " 
as pakistani prime minister jamali officially announced the conclusion of the summit , he praised the important agreement that aims at fighting terrorism , alleviating poverty and establishing a free trade zone by 2006 . 
he also praised the summit for " infusing new vitality into the regional cooperation . " 
( international ) china and albania sign agreement for economic and technological cooperation 
under the agreement , china will provide 15 million yuan in grants to albania to be used in the economic and technological cooperation projects agreed upon by the two countries or china will provide general goods to albania . 
after the signing ceremony , hajdaraga expressed his thanks to the chinese government for providing the grants and extended his spring festival greetings to the chinese people . 
he said signing this agreement showed the friendship between china and albania and their close cooperation in all fields . 
from now on , the friendly cooperation between the two countries built on mutual trust will be furthered strengthened . 
tian changchun said that by providing the grants to albania , china demonstrated the friendly ties between the chinese government and people and the albanian government and people as well as the traditional friendship and cooperation between the two countries . 
since the security council delegation visited the six west african countries at the end of june last year , the overall situation in the entire region has seen encouraging changes , though the situation in a few countries turned back to turmoil for a time . 
equally encouraging is that with the deployment of the un special delegation to liberia , liberia is gradually walking out of the turmoil brought by protracted wars and starting to embark on the road to recovery and reconstruction . 
the political process in guinea @-@ bissau has also made positive progress . the transitional government has promised to hold the legislative election in march this year . 
we expect that the security council will make the decision as soon as possible . 
the secretariat , ecowas and other relevant parties also worked hard to solve cross @-@ border issues such as salw trafficking , mercenary activities and recruitment of child soldiers from the perspective of the region and have achieved positive results . 
( international ) arab league secretary general urges u.s. not to impose " democracy " on middle east 
xinhua news agency , geneva , january 21 on the 21 st , mussa , secretary general of the league of arab states , urged the united states to discuss democracy with arab nations instead of trying to impose democracy on the middle east . 
in an interview with reporters at the annual meeting of world economic forum held in davos , switzerland , mussa said : " if they ( americans ) want to establish democracy in the middle east , they 'd better keep their promise and establish democracy first in iraq . " 
he said the arab league is the best partner to discuss with the united states about carrying out democratic reforms in the middle east . 
" as long as you put forward your point of view and are willing to listen to ours , we can talk about any idea . 
we don't oppose democracy , but democracy is not an operation or order that has to be implemented immediately . " 
mussa said that the u.s. government so far has failed to convince people that its occupation of iraq will bring " democracy " to the country . 
" they said they were going to iraq to show us a democratic model to follow . 
yet so far we haven't seen anything . " 
although the result of the presidential election held on the 4 th in georgia has not yet been officially announced , the victory of saakashvili , the national movement leader who is a candidate jointly nominated by the right @-@ wing political parties , is a foregone conclusion . 
georgia 's central election commission announced on the 7 th that based on the statistics of 89 % of votes , more than 95 % of voters supported saakashvili . 
some heads of state from the commonwealth of independent states have also sent messages of congratulation to this young politician . 
in fact , saakashvili already declared his own victory as early as the very night after the election was over . 
he called the result " the victory of the people , " and said that georgia will act promptly to create a new future . 
when interviewed by the news media , many voters said that casting votes for saakashvili means choosing " a new hope . " 
even the former president shevardnadze who was forced to resign also expressed his support for this former political opponent by praising him as " young , energetic and well @-@ educated . " 
while placing their hope on saakashvili , people also noticed that not many changes have taken place in georgia in the two months since shevardnadze resigned . 
in other words , what the president @-@ elect has to face will still be the old problems . 
large population and underdevelopment are two major national conditions of china . 
this is what chinese leaders must keep firmly in their mind at any time . 
to solve the problem of 1.3 billion people , we can only rely on ourselves and nobody else . 
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have made great achievements in our development , yet at the same time we have taken some detours and missed a few opportunities . 
after we started the reform and opening up in 1978 , we finally found a right way for our own development . 
that is : chinese people build socialism with chinese characteristics independently and autonomously . 
its essence is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop productive forces , and respect and ensure chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness . 
china 's reform and opening up extended from rural areas to cities and from the economical area to political , cultural and social areas . 
according to statistics , young people who choose to commit suicide are mostly teenagers 15 to 19 years of age , but it is also not uncommon for children as young as 10 to 14 years old . 
academic pressure and disappointment resulting from failed expectation also certainly pertain to the category of communication between parents and children . 
the pressure of getting into a higher school is an inevitable burden on local school children during their growing up . sometimes the pressure is self @-@ induced , while more often the pressure is imposed on children by their parents . 
parents demand children have good academic performance and compare their own children with other children at every chance . although the demand of academic excellence puts quite a lot of pressure on children , the mediation and communication behind the pressure are the true indicators of the relationship between parents and children . 
it is known that many young students who need counseling became mentally disturbed after they were pushed into desperation by their parents ' over @-@ expectations . 
the success and rapid development of singapore make parents feel their children are much better provided for than they themselves were and therefore they naturally expect their children to perform better than they themselves did . 
more often than not , parents forget that they actually might not be particularly outstanding in all fields when they themselves were children . 
recently , iraq 's interim governing council and the u.s. occupying authorities signed an agreement in baghdad , announcing a timetable for a step @-@ by @-@ step transfer of power to hand over the government back to iraq by june next year . 
the iraqis gave a cold response ; public opinions in the united states even consider it " a big gamble . " 
in short , most people are still somewhat skeptical and choose to wait and see . 
it is not without reason that the international community has so many doubts . 
as people see it , the united states is not returning power to iraq out of its own accord . it is therefore impossible to have a complete transfer of power and there are bound to be many unexpected developments . 
first , the interim transitional government set to be established in may next year is not to be directly elected by the iraqi people but will be elected by the " transitional national assembly " that is selected by 18 governorate selection caucuses . 
this will be hard to be free from suspicion of the u.s. control and its legitimacy may be questioned . 
second , the united states has already announced that it will not withdraw its military forces after handing over the power . it will merely change the original " military occupation " to " military presence . " 
bush barely keeps plans for a free trade area at americas summit 
( afp , mexico , monterrey , january 13 ) the plan to establish a free trade area of the americas next year ambitiously promoted by the u.s. president bush won the grudging support from the leaders of other 33 nations at the summit of the americas today . 
however , participating nations were divided on the issue of how to combat aggravating poverty in the western hemisphere , and the united states also failed to include an anti @-@ corruption clause in the final communique . 
the free trade area of the americas , stretching from alaska on the north to argentina on the south , will be the largest of its kind in the world with a market of about 800 million people and a gross domestic product of up to 13 trillion u.s. dollars . 
however , at the close of the two @-@ day summit , argentine president kirchner attacked the u.s. plan in his speech , saying that establishing a free trade area alone cannot solve the problems of the americas . 
when the " preemptive " theory was first proposed , some prominent u.s. politicians asked the question : " what if other countries all follow the example ? " 
just as they expected , more and more countries claimed that they also want to go " preemptive " in the recent two years and their number is growing . 
this is a new trend that warrants attention and study . 
in the very month when bush proposed " the preemptive strategy , " australian prime minister howard was the first one to stand up and show his support . 
he said that australia would adopt " preemptive " tactics and have no scruples about taking military actions in the neighboring countries once it received any confirmed intelligence that terrorists were to attack australia . 
he even proposed that the principle of " preemption " be written into the un charter as he considered it necessary to amend the un charter so as to give all nations " preemptive " rights to fight terrorists or countries that support terrorism . 
after the war in iraq , japan became even more unscrupulous in its advocacy of the " preemptive " strategy . 
pakistani president musharraf wins vote of confidence in both houses 
information minister rashid told afp reporters : " musharraf won the majority vote of the national assembly . 
there was not a single vote against him . " 
in the 342 @-@ seat national assembly , 191 members voted in favor of musharraf ; islamist lawmakers abstained from voting while the opposition parties boycotted this controversial confidence vote . 
musharraf made concessions to the coalition of the six islamist parties . he agreed to resign as an army chief and to require the approval of the supreme court within a month for dissolving the national assembly . 
in the 100 @-@ seat senate , 56 members voted in favor of musharraf ; 42 islamist members and opposition members either abstained from voting or boycotted . 
musharraf came to power during a coup in october 1999 and has ever since refused to step down . 
actual number of private @-@ owned enterprises in guangdong exceeds for the first time that of state @-@ owned and controlled enterprises 
according to statistics , as of the end of 2003 , there are 690,000 enterprises of various kinds ( including domestic @-@ funded , private @-@ owned and foreign @-@ invested enterprises ) in total in the province , an increase of 0.59 % over the previous year . 
for the first time , the actual number of private @-@ owned enterprises exceeded that of state @-@ owned and controlled enterprises . 
statistics show that in 2003 , newly registered enterprises of all kinds in the province totaled 105,000 , forming a pattern of one drop and two increases . 
among them , there are 17,000 domestic @-@ funded enterprises , a drop of 17.6 % from the same period of previous year , 81,600 private @-@ owned enterprises and 6,561 foreign @-@ invested enterprises with increases of 29 % and 0.08 % respectively over the same period of previous year . 
the ratios of domestic @-@ funded , private @-@ owned and foreign @-@ invested enterprises over the total number of newly registered enterprises are respectively 16 :@ 78 @:@ 6 . 
shrinking workforce bound to impact economic output in eu and japan 
in contrast , the abundant labor force in developing countries such as india and china should be able to help boost economic growth . 
sammans , the executive chairman of watson wyatt worldwide , said : " workforce growth and productivity will determine economic output . 
in countries with great labor shortage , supplies of goods and services may not be able to meet the demand and living standards . " 
the statement also warned : " japan 's share will have shrunk from 8 % to 4 % . " 
among the advisors and distinguished guests who attend this conference are famous top leaders of multinational corporations , world renowned economists and accomplished experts and scholars . 
i am deeply touched by the sincere cooperation and the active and pragmatic approach demonstrated by all the advisors . 
bringing our cooperation and collective wisdom into full play not only helps in planning and promoting the development of guangdong but also helps our concerted efforts in promoting cooperation and development in all fields . 
i had been looking forward to the 2003 international consultation conference on economic development of guangdong so that i can listen to and learn about your valuable advice on the economic and social development of guangdong . 
we are happily gathering here today to pursue one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchange , seek more space for development , infuse new vitalities into the economic and social development of guangdong and create opportunities for the development of your businesses . 
china 's accession to the wto marks a brand new phase of the opening up to the outside world as we are participating in the international competition in broader areas , more extensive fields and at higher levels . 
as a province with the highest degree of overseas @-@ oriented economy in the mainland , guangdong has been the first to experience the unprecedented opportunities for development and to meet the accompanying harsh challenges . 
the people of guangdong are focused on building an overall well @-@ to @-@ do society and accelerating their efforts for modernization , which will create more opportunities and room for development for all our friends . 
the economy of guangdong , thriving with vitality and broad prospects , is rising vigorously to new heights . 
aids @-@ infected children rejected for school admission ; angry priest director takes government to court 
although 2.5 million people are estimated to have hiv in the country , aids and hiv are still taboo topics in kenya . 
d'agostino is seeking a court order to compel public schools to admit children regardless of their hiv status . 
the ministry of education of kenya said through its lawyer gacivih that it was not aware of such discrimination but could understand what the schools did . 
gacivih said the ministry of education is willing to discuss and solve the issue with nyumbani children 's home located in the northwestern suburbs of nairobi . 
judge koome ordered both parties to hold discussions today and report the result tomorrow . 
( international ) wto submits " byrd subsidy " dispute for arbitration 
the petitions for sanctions originated from the united states ' failure to repeal " the byrd amendment " within the deadline set by wto . 
the u.s. move was opposed by its major trade partners including the eu and japan . 
wto finally ruled in january 2003 that the amendment violated the rules of the world trade and required the united states to repeal it by december 27 of the same year . 
but the united states did not implement the wto ruling . 
however , the united states immediately challenged the extent of the sanctions and the validity of the petitions . 
the second round of six @-@ nation talks on north korean nuclear issue ended the way it was generally expected . 
during the talks , all parties concerned got together and explored the peripheral issues of the peninsula nuclear crisis and reached consensus on holding the third round of talks before the end of june this year , setting up a working group and other matters . 
both of the two protagonists , the united states and north korea , showed no concession ; and each stayed firm with its basic position . 
what draws attention , however , is the u.s. attitude at the talks that showed no urgency to solve the problems and gave the impression of " footdragging . " 
this tactic that the united states showed is closely linked with the new developments of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in these new developments . 
gdp is a globally accepted important macroeconomic indicator . 
it is of crucial importance to maintain the growth of gdp throughout the entire process of our country 's modernization . 
for the simple reason that an increase of one percentage point from the current gdp of our country can result in more than 800,000 jobs , we all must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth . 
to realize the grand goal of building an overall well @-@ to @-@ do society and the third @-@ phase strategic goal of modernization depends very much on the sustained rapid growth of gdp . 
however , we should see that gdp , as an indicator , has its own flaw . 
for example , it cannot easily reflect the quality and composition of economic growth accurately , cannot easily reflect the actual level of social welfare people enjoy , nor can it measure accurately the social distribution and social fairness , and so on . 
on the other hand , gdp is not the only indicator . 
therefore , we must treat the existing gdp verification system scientifically both in thinking and approaches and find the right place for gdp in the entire economic and social development . 
we must maintain some level of its growth rate , but at the same time we should not overvalue it . and we should certainly not exclusively and purposely seek after it . 
( international ) airbus surpassed boeing in deliveries for the first time last year 
last year airbus delivered slightly more aircraft than the 303 it delivered in 2002 . 
the company forecast the market will continue to be sluggish this year and therefore it will deliver " close to 300 " aircraft . 
earlier this month , the u.s. boeing co. announced that it delivered 281 aircraft last year and will expect to deliver between 275 to 290 aircraft this year . 
in 2003 , airbus 's share of global deliveries jumped to 52 % . its share of global deliveries was 38 % and 44 % respectively in 2001 and in 2002 . 
last year , airbus received 280 orders worth 32.8 billion u.s. dollars . excluding the 30 orders that were cancelled midway , the actual number of orders was 254 , accounting for 52 % of global deliveries . 
in any country , police , prosecutors and courts should not only be symbols of justice and fairness but also form the most important system of safeguarding social stability . 
but unfortunately , they have become symbols of corruption in china . 
according to the latest report from the national auditing department , the audition of the financial expenditures in the public security agencies in 26 provinces and cities last year shows that the public security agencies in the country had illegally collected a total of 16.5 billion yuan in fines and penalties . 
the crisis of trust in police , prosecutors and courts has now come out into the open . 
the cases of liu yong and sun zhigang and the recent " bmw " incident all reflect this profound crisis of trust . 
the " bmw " incident is even more typical . 
people are far more concerned with this issue than their concern with sars during the sars period . 
in fact , what people are concerned is not the " bmw " incident itself , but the fact they could no longer trust the entire judicial system . 
being clearly aware of that , the relevant department soon put a tight lid on the media . 
but , the problem is still there . 
( international ) both black boxes found for the passenger plane that crashed over red sea 
both black boxes were found at a depth of more than 1,000 meters about 30 meters apart . 
shaker qelada , head of the egyptian accident investigation commission , said the first black box recorded various technical data of the plane before the crash and will be " decrypted and analyzed " by laboratories of egypt 's civil aviation ministry . 
although the black box appears badly damaged , qelada said it is " in fair conditions . " 
the so @-@ called two black boxes on the plane are actually colored light yellow . 
they are designed to continue sending signals for 30 days after falling into the sea as deep as 6,000 meters so as to help rescue crew locate their positions for recovery . 
the passenger plane that crashed over the red sea waters belonged to egypt 's private flash airlines . 
the boeing 737 passenger plane crashed into the red sea shortly after taking off from the egypt 's tourist resort sharm el @-@ sheikh on the 3 rd of this month , killing 148 , including 134 french tourists and a moroccan as well as 13 egyptian crew members . 
the egyptian and french experts think this crash was caused by technical problems rather than terrorist attacks or explosions and the recovery of the two black boxes on the plane will help reveal the answer . 
democrats attack bush for creating new axis of evil 
( afp , washington , january 21 ) on the evening of the 20 th , u.s. opposition democrats accused president bush of leading the united states into isolation from the rest of the world and creating a new " axis of evil " with his policies . 
when democrats rebroadcast the president 's state of union address , house democratic leader pelosi lashed out on the human and financial costs caused by last year 's military invasion of iraq . 
with the upcoming u.s. presidential election ( u.s. presidential election is to be held on november 2 this year ) , democrats are attacking bush with greater intensity . 
clark , one of the major contenders for the democratic presidential nomination , said that bush has created his own " axis of evil . " 
bush coined the phrase of " axis of evil " two years ago in his state of union address to describe some countries that threaten the united states . 
clark said : " that is the axis of fiscal policies that threaten our future , foreign policies that threaten our security and domestic policies that put an end to families . " 
economic development and poverty eradication are the basic prerequisites for ensuring sustainable development . 
the sustainable development of economy is the material basis for environmental protection and all @-@ round social progress . 
without solution to the issue of subsistence , there will be no development to speak of , let alone sustainable development . 
to promote economic development and strive to eliminate poverty are the necessary steps that developing countries must take to achieve sustainable development . 
without solution to the issue of poverty in developing countries , the developed countries will find it hard to sustain their own development . 
to use the resources rationally and to protect the environment are the necessary requirements for achieving sustainable development . 
it is impossible for the development to sustain itself if it is achieved at the expense of squandering resources and ruining the environment . 
only by adopting a recycling economy that is based on the most efficient use of resources and the protection of the environment can we achieve sustainable development . 
to achieve all @-@ round social progress and enhance the quality of people 's life are the ultimate goals of sustainable development . 
seven years after nixon visited china and sino @-@ u . s. shanghai communique was announced , the carter administration accepted china 's position on the taiwan issue and established diplomatic relations between china and the united states . 
this event and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states opened a new page in the sino @-@ american relations . 
in the early reagan administration , china and the united states had fierce clashes on the taiwan issue . 
after painstaking negotiations , the two governments announced the famous august 17 communique in 1982 and reached an agreement on the step @-@ by @-@ step resolution of the arms sales to taiwan . 
shanghai communique , the communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between china and the united states , and the august 17 communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for the sino @-@ u . s. relations . 
during the ten years after the establishment of diplomatic relations , although the two countries fought over the taiwan issue and others from time to time , the overall sino @-@ u . s. relations were stable with increasing contact and cooperation in all aspects . 
in the 1980 s and early 1990 s , east europe underwent dramatic transformation . with the dissolution of the soviet union and ending of the cold war , the international situation had experienced the most profound change since world war ii . 
the united states took the lead in imposing sanctions against china by announcing the sales of 150 f @-@ 16 fighter jets to taiwan and linking the issue of human rights with the status of the most favorable nation . its permission of lee tung @-@ hui to visit the united states brought the sino @-@ u . s. relations to its lowest level . 
with the rapid economic development in china , china 's international status is continuously on the rise . 
more and more people in the united states have come to realize that it is in the interest of both china and the united states to improve and develop the sino @-@ u . s. relations . 
just as anticipated , malaysian prime minister abdullah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday and the general election for the new parliament will be held in the coming days . 
only four months have passed now since abdullah took over from mahathir last november . 
in spite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election ahead of schedule . 
doubtlessly , abdullah 's decision to hold a blitz election shows that he has already made a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in the country . 
the current economy in malaysia is performing well and there is no issue that the opposition party can make a big case of or capitalize to their advantages . 
in the meantime , he urged to improve the efficiency of civil services , which is another action to boost peoples morale . 
( international ) u.s. aid team says assistance to iran not political 
catlin said that there was " nothing political " for the united states to organize this aid team and the united states had provided similar humanitarian assistance to iran in the past as well . 
he said the aid team , which is comprised of 84 people , has set up an urban search and rescue team and a field hospital in the area of bam . in addition , a few detachments are in charge of going to the city to assess building damages . 
they also brought shipments of plastic sheets , tents and other rescue supplies . 
when asked how long the u.s. aid team will be staying in bam , catlin said : " we will stay as long as the host ( iranian government ) allows . " 
catlin also said that the u.s. aid team is free to move around in bam and no iranian police are protecting or keeping track of them . 
he also considered the iranian government 's response to the earthquake and capability to handle the disaster " first @-@ rate and outstanding . " 
the u.s. agency for international development is a subsidiary of the agency for international development and cooperation and is administered by the u.s. state department . 
the united states and iran haven't resumed normal relations ever since they severed their diplomatic ties in 1980 . 
the united states has so far still considered iran as one of " axis of evil " nations that " support terrorism . " 
the u.s. move to dispatch the aid team to iran was made on the invitation of the iranian ambassador to the united nations . 
however , the challenges in the past were not limited to government @-@ funded public housing . private housing was also greatly challenged . 
the financial crisis in 1997 led to the burst of assets bubble . as a result , real estate prices plunged by 70 % , hitting property owners really hard . this was also the main reason that deflation was aggravated several times over the past five years . 
now that economy is turning around , we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure the real estate market will continue its steady growth . 
a healthy real estate market is indeed of crucial importance to the continuous recovery of hong kong 's economy . 
we are also devoted to protecting and improving our living environment . 
our future efforts should be based on the principle of sustainable development . we will improve our living environment through more proper urban design and better protection of natural and cultural heritage in hong kong . 
we will double our attention to the issue of overall environment . 
the lesson we learned from the sars outbreak in hong kong last year reminds us that we must make every effort to create a more spacious , cleaner and healthier living environment . 
we will provide better landscaping and more greenery ; and add parks and leisure and recreational facilities for the benefit of the community . 
education is the cornerstone of the modern civilization . 
to enhance the overall quality of the people in our country and increase total national capabilities , education must be vigorously promoted . 
rural education has a wide range of impact and affects the overall rural economy and social development . 
since the reform and opening up , tremendous and profound changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas in our country . this owes a great deal to the education , especially the rural education . 
the implementation in rural areas of the family contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output has greatly liberated the productive forces . 
the emergence in the world of a revolution in new science and technology and the progress made in building an overall well @-@ to @-@ do society have raised higher demands for the scientific , cultural , ideological and moral qualifications of the vast majority of rural population . 
without the implementation of universal compulsory 9 th grade education in rural areas and comprehensive enhancement of qualification of peasants , it would be very hard to realize an overall well @-@ to @-@ do society . 
we must fully recognize that rural education constitutes a fundamental , precursory and integral part of our efforts to building an overall well @-@ to @-@ do society . 
ruling does not mean enjoying power , but assuming more responsibilities . 
for a long time , the dpp has played a role of " government performing multiple functions in promoting taiwan 's diplomacy and has achieved brilliant results . 
in march of next year , i myself will officially assume chairmanship of council of asian liberals & democrats ,  and i hope that in the capacity of a leader of an international organization , i can create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute more to the international community . 
in addition , the dpp has also actively involved in the affairs of liberal international after becoming its official member last year . 
apart from sending staff to serve as human rights commissioners in the secretariat of its headquarters in london , we will also cooperate with other member parties and hold seminars on political reforms in central and south america , europe and other regions . 
shenzhen to implement health and quarantine inspection of exiting and entering drivers against sars 
the bureau also calls for active cooperation between the relevant agencies and passing drivers in carrying out this measure to effectively prevent sars from spreading through shenzhen ports of entry and safeguard the health of general public . 
the talks covered such issues as politics , humanitarian aids , security in iraq and the appointment of the un special representative to iraq , upon which the three parties exchanged their opinions in a candid manner . 
at a time when the u.s. -@ british plan of transfer of power to iraq is facing boycott , whether or how the united nations will get involved in rebuilding iraq certainly draws much attention . 
since the united states declared the end of major combat in iraq in early may last year , the situation in iraq has remained precarious . attacks against the occupation forces were frequent , inflicting heavy casualties on the u.s. -@ british coalition forces that have enjoyed little lull of peace . 
the former iraqi president saddam was captured on december 13 last year , but the u.s. euphoria did not last long . security remained unimproved and resistance escalated , throwing the occupying authority into a dilemma . 
on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab countries are unanimously demanding the pull @-@ out of foreign troops and the return of power to iraqis so as to let the iraqi people govern their own country . 
meanwhile , the united states and britain are trying hard to reshape the iraqi government according to their own will , through which they plan to gradually and " gracefully " extricate themselves from the dilemma . 
therefore , the method and process of the power transfer have become the focus of the current iraqi affairs . 
whereas , the shiites that make up the majority of iraqi population stress that for a truly fair transfer of power to iraq , a national direct election should be held . 
u.s. to release hundreds of iraqi prisoners 
pachachi praised the occupying coalition for making the aforementioned move and claimed it as a result of the governing council 's aggressive lobbying . 
pachachi told reporters : " the governing council has long been committed to spreading the spirit of reconciliation among the iraqi people . in order to achieve this goal , we asked the coalition to review the issue of prisoners . " 
the coalition spokesman , who declined to be named , said later that a total of 506 prisoners are scheduled to be released in the coming weeks . 
bremer told reporters in his brief address : " the coalition will release the first 100 prisoners tomorrow . " 
bremer made this gesture of reconciliation at a time when the occupying coalition is making every effort to appease pent @-@ up grudges of the sunnis to which hussein belonged . 
hussein was captured alive by the u.s. military eight months after he was on the run . 
bremer said : " hussein the tyrant has now become a prisoner . most of his henchmen are either killed or captured . now its time for reconciliation . " 
prisoners are to be released on the condition that they " must renounce violence " and find prominent people in the community or religious and tribal leaders as their guarantors to be responsible for their good conduct . 
bremer said none of those to be released have been directly involved in attacks on american forces or other deadly attacks nor have they been involved in any torture or crimes against humanity . 
bremer said that those to be released " have made a mistake and have now repented , " and " we are prepared to give some of them a chance to start anew . " 
burundi president : former rebel forces to join military leadership 
the former rebel " forces for the defense of democracy " welcomed the move , praising it as a " crucial step " toward establishing a new armed forces . 
ndayizeye said : " all parties that signed the agreement ( cease @-@ fire agreement in november 2003 ) must complete arrangements for the stationing of soldiers by january 5 at the latest . " 
he added that preparations for the joint chiefs of staff which includes the former leaders of rebel forces must be completed by january 7 . 
this operation mainly has something to do with the " forces for the defense of democracy , " the largest of the six rebel forces groups that signed the peace agreement . 
the forces for national liberation ,  the seventh rebel forces group , refused to sign the peace agreement . 
since the civil war broke out between the rebel forces of the ethnic hutus and tutsi government forces in 1993 , it has claimed about 300,000 lives in burundi . 
recently , the european media has been discussing a hot topic : whether the " big three " summit of german chancellor schoder , french president chirac and british prime minister blair is gradually institutionalized . 
the media calls the " big three " of germany , france and britain the eu 's " new troika " and the relations among the three countries the " new triangular relations . " 
a survey of european history of a hundred years shows that the triangular relations among germany , france and britain have one basic characteristic : the alliance between britain and france in controlling or opposing germany . 
two world wars are the proofs . 
in the era of cold war , both east germany and west germany were respectively constrained by warshaw convention and north atlantic treaty organization . 
however , with " germany @-@ france axis " back into operation and the fierce conflict between the concepts of the unipolarization and multipolarization of the world , the eu has become seriously divided internally on the issue of iraq in recent years . 
the " old europe " represented by germany and france holds exactly the opposite position from that of " new europe " represented by britain and poland on the issue of the iraq war . 
furthermore , the split happens to occur exactly at a time when the eu is going to have the largest expansion in its history . 
asia boasts time @-@ honored and brilliant cultures . the yellow river , the yangtze river valley , the indus and the ganges , the euphrates and the tigris basin are all famous cradles of human civilization . 
in the long course of history , the asian peoples have made remarkable contributions to the development of human civilization . 
since the modern period , asia has undergone great changes and suffered numerous hardships . in order to win liberation and seek development , people in all asian countries have made untiring efforts and achieved tremendous accomplishments . 
however , it is still a long way to go before asia can rise anew and rejuvenate . 
strengthening cooperation , promoting development and creating win @-@ win situations are the only ways through which asia can rise anew and rejuvenate . it is also where the fundamental interest of asian people lies . 
in the new situation of the millennium , the development of asia is facing new opportunities . 
peace and development are still the main topics in today 's time . an overall peaceful international environment has provided favorable external conditions for the development of asia . 
with its rich resources and vast market , asia is the most economically viable region in the world and promises tremendous potential for development . 
contact with mars rover spirit lost , says nasa 
( afp , washington , january 22 ) nasa officials said today that the agency has lost contact with the u.s. exploration rover spirit that has landed on mars due to a serious problem on the rover . 
theisinger , project manager of the mars exploration rover mission , said : " we found there is a very serious anomaly on the rover . " 
nasa said yesterday that scientists were unable to send daily instructions to spirit because of thunder and lightning over australia . 
however , experts now believe it is a more serious problem that has caused the breakdown in communications . 
the spirit exploration rover arrived on mars on january 3 and started its search last week for signs of past life on the red planet . 
its twin rover , " opportunity , " is scheduled to land at night between january 24 and january 25 . 
this mission of exploration costs 820 million u.s. dollars and it was originally expected that both solar @-@ powered rovers could operate for about three months . 
( sports ) rusedski : i 'm a victim to atp 
xinhua news agency , london , january 9 rusedski , the tennis player who admitted his drug test came out positive , said on the 9 th that there are many tennis players taking performance enhancing drugs out there and he is just a scapegoat for association of tennis professionals . 
rusedski is britain 's no. 2 tennis player for men . 
on the 8 th , he admitted that he took a drug test during a tournament in july last year . the atp anti @-@ doping administrator advised him that there was a low concentration of nandrolone metabolites in his urine sample . 
rusedski said on the 9 th that actually more than 40 first @-@ rate tennis players tested positive for even higher concentration of nandrolone in their urine samples ; only he ended up as a victim . 
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old rusedski said : " i happened to be singled out . the way i was treated was wrong , unfair and discriminatory . 
instead of suing me , they should make a thorough investigation as to how it happened . " 
rusedski vowed to " fight till the end " for his innocence . 
he firmly denied having used any banned drug to enhance his performance . 
he said the root cause of the incident is not himself but the entire tennis community . 
an ancient arab saying goes : " one day 's turmoil is more horrible than a thousand years of tyranny . " 
is this what the northeast asian countries are currently worried about ? 
i think the answer is probably affirmative . 
the attitude of the countries in the region toward these tactics is the focus of this survey . 
in addition , the survey also analyzes the threats posed by north korea 's nuclear weapons program based on the possibility of nuclear attacks and the potential damage they can cause as perceived by the peoples of north korea 's neighboring countries and their sense of fear . 
both china and russia consider the danger of north korea 's use of nuclear weapons low or very low , while japan and south korea regard it as a significant threat . 
all northeast asian countries agree that they should keep engaging north korea . 
japan , on the other hand , supports containment and deterrence . other countries also consider the strategy of containment and deterrence acceptable under certain circumstances . 
i know that legislative council started to discuss with the government about the site of the permanent office of legislative council as early as ten years ago . 
likewise , the government has also been pondering over the long @-@ term plan of relocating the government headquarters for more than a decade . 
therefore , i understand the government 's decision to postpone the tamar project which includes the new legislative council complex will certainly disappoint some of the legislators . 
i know that the legislators will have to suffer some inconvenience by continuing to work in a less than satisfactory place for this period of time . 
however , just as i said to my colleagues in the government who are also affected by this decision , i hope everybody can give priority to public interests , understand the factors involved and exercise more patience during this period . 
postponing the project of the new legislative council complex at tamar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government in the coming years . it is in the public interests and is also accepted by the public . 
the government will resume the project of developing the new legislative council complex at tamar as soon as public finances improve . our current plan will do so . 
as the largest debtor country in the world , the united states has seen the increase of its foreign debt again . 
the u.s. department of the treasury announced on january 16 that as of the end of september last year , the debt the united states owed various types of foreign creditors hit a total of 6.494 trillion u.s. dollars , up 2.2 % over the figure last released . 
on the average , each american owes more than 20,000 u.s. dollars in foreign debt . 
statistics show that private foreign investors control about 40 % of the u.s. government bonds . 
this inevitably reminds us of keynes ' proposal to president roosevelt in the first half of the 20 th century : adopting a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home while making up for the financial loss by means of foreign debt . 
this measure indeed played an important role in stimulating the " effective demand " to solve the impending economic crisis . 
however , people have noticed that many u.s. administrations tended to use it as a " miraculous cure . " 
but since the 1980 s when president reagan advocated tax cuts and military expansion , the u.s. deficit has been climbing up and the united states eventually has become the largest debtor nation . 
south korea steps up quarantine against spread of bird flu 
( afp , seoul , january 14 ) south korean officials said that after a lull of nine days , a new outbreak of bird flu is again reported in south korea . south korea has stepped up quarantine efforts to prevent the bird flu from further spreading . 
south korea 's department of agriculture said that a tight quarantine zone has been established near a chicken farm in yangsan , 390 kilometers southeast of seoul . 
officials from ministry of health detected the bird flu virus in this zone on monday . 
it is the first time in nine days that south korea has confirmed the discovery of the bird flu virus . 
last month , the bird flu hit 15 areas in south korea . after the authorities were forced to slaughter nearly 2 million chickens and ducks , the highly contagious poultry disease was apparently contained . 
kim chang @-@ seob , head of animal health division of south korea 's ministry of health , said : " we are culling all the chickens in the affected area and strictly restricting the movement of the poultry . " 
the new case of bird flu has prompted south korean government officials to step up quarantine efforts in other areas . 
kim chang @-@ seob said that this bird flu virus can survive in dust for two weeks and at least for 35 days in poultrys excrement .

in recent years , greece has adopted a policy of improving relations with turkey and no longer interfered against turkey 's accession to the european union , which has greatly improved the relations between the two countries . 
( international ) livestock husbandry in mongolia took a turn for the better in 2003 
this is the first time that the population of livestock in mongolia has risen after it fell sharply for three years in a row . 
last year , there was abundant rainfall in summer and no heavy snow in spring and winter , which provided good conditions for a turnaround of mongolia 's livestock husbandry . 
as of the end of 2003 , the country boasted 255,600 camels , 1,958,300 horses , 1,784,300 cattle , 10,706,200 sheep and 10,603,400 goats . 
compared with the same period of previous year , the numbers of camels , goats and sheep increased , whereas the numbers of horses and cattle somewhat decreased . 
the privatization of livestock husbandry in mongolia was basically completed in the 90 s of last century . 
however , the privatization of livestock husbandry resulted in a total " dependency on weather . " 
thanks to favorable weather , livestock husbandry in mongolia enjoyed six consecutive years of growth from 1994 to 1999 . 
by the end of 1999 , mongolia had 33,500,000 heads of livestock , setting the highest record in history . 
however , three years of heavy winter snowfalls and summer droughts from 2000 to 2002 also caused livestock husbandry in mongolia to suffer three consecutive years of setbacks . 
by the end of 2002 , mongolia had only 23,684,500 heads of livestock , a decrease of 9,815,500 heads over the three years .

( international observation ) hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet 
xinhua news february 9 from ramallah ( internationl observation ) . hamas looks for breakthrough in forming cabinet 
xinhua news reporter hao huangmin 
after the palestine islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) obtained victory in legislative elections , how it will paint a blueprint for a new government has become a focal point the whole world is concerned with at the moment . 
what kinds of new policies hamas will put forth will directly influence the direction taken by all concerned parties in corresponding policy for the peace process . 
at the same time , the attitude of resistance of america and israel adds even more variables to the prospects of the hamas government . 
at present , various palestinian factions are currently tightening their cooperation , and are actively searching for breakthroughs on the future development of the situation on sensitive points and difficulties that forming a cabinet involves . 
( sub heading ) who will the position of premier fall to ? 
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , there have been people in the outside world who worry a ' hamas premier ' will likely see differently than the current high leader abbas . 
also , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , emphasized that the new palestinian government established by hamas leaders will not continue to recognize israel . this intransigent standpoint also intensifies the worry of the international community . 
america and israel explicitly state they will not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and have used this threat to cut off economic support and transmission of taxation to palestine . 
however , this has not obstructed hamas in making flexible policy adjustments - choosing independents is a policy to split the difference . 
according to reports , to acquire international approval across the largest range possible , earlier domestic and foreign hamas leaders meeting together in egypt decided to choose independent ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of trustees of the islamic university in gaza , to be appointed the new premier . 
this move has still not received the responses of concerned parties . 
palestine analyst hussein said that no matter who the position of premier falls to , what is most crucial is the choice for premier must dilute the ' hard ' aspects of hamas as much as possible . only by doing this can the successful forming of a cabinet be secured . 
( sub heading ) how to allocate power 
looking at the internal makeup of the party , the biggest challenge that hamas faces in forming a cabinet is it lacks ample experience being in power . 
hamas brought up establishing a ' government partner ' relationship with fatah after the elections to jointly establish a united ethnic government , however fatah has not given a positive response to this as of the present . 
opinions among those in the fatah party as to whether or not to enter the cabinet are not the same . one faction advocates participating in the new government , and thus having something to say ; another faction refuses the invitation of hamas , and would rather be an ' active opposition faction ' in the legislature . 
persons with sensitive information pointed out that under the advice of abbas , fatah is progressively leaning towards entering into the new government . 
although this might be the case , hamas and fatah would still haggle over the allocation of cabinet positions . 
besides this , another path would be to establish a cabinet that is free of party affiliations and outside the framework of the legislature . 
according to reports , hamas has also designed a technocracy government , but the concrete list of names is still unknown . 
in light of the attitude of israel and america , a technocracy government might still be accepted as a method to form a cabinet that would lessen outside pressure . 
according to regulations of the palestine " basic law , " after the new legislature convenes on the february 16 , the nominations for premier and forming of a cabinet will be completed in three to five weeks . 
( sub heading ) at a loss about armed forces 
the weapons in the hands of hamas are another thorny problem that the forming of a new government faces . 
america 's and israel 's attitude is extremely stiff . they staunchly demand hamas give up violence , and reject hamas taking part in government while carrying guns . 
hamas leader mashal emphasized on february 9 that armed resistance is the ' strategic choice ' of his organization . 
the arms problem in actuality includes two levels of problems : the legality of weapons , and the jurisdiction and management of armed forces . 
hamas once brought up unifying all armed factions into a palestine ethnic power organization ' people 's army . ' however it did not get a broad response , and also took criticism from the palestinian islamic jihad movement . 
at present , palestine has over 60,000 security organization personnel , the vast majority of which come from the fatah camp . 
also , fatah has some subordinate armed factions with loose organizational relations , such as the ' al @-@ aqsa martyrs ' brigades ' and the ' fatah hawks ' and others . 
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must come to an understanding with abbas on how to manage these armed forces that each have their own power structures , and allocate the power of management of security in a reasonable way . 
according to the reports of local media , abbas is interested in managing the security and information regiments , while the police and people 's guard and other organizations will be subordinate to the management of the department of the interior of the new government . 
however , all sides are still carrying out discussions on this sensitive issue , and as of now there is nothing further . 
accident occurs on beijing to harbin highway waste oil leakage closes off section of road

a part of the harbin section of the road in both directions is closed and many vehicles have circumvented this section . 
at present , relevant departments are cleaning up the scene and the cause of the accident is under investigation . 
( foreign affairs concerning china ) development trend of china @-@ myanmar economic and trade relations excellent , potential is huge

in 2004 while both countries ' high level leaders visited each other , both parties signed 33 economic and trade cooperation agreements . among these the great majority are currently being carried out and implemented .

south african minister assigned to china expressed south africa does not have ' organized ' crime directed at chinese citizens . 
he also expressed that the south african government will do its best to " crush all forms of criminal activities . " 
koloane expressed that the south african government hopes to " lower to zero " the crime rate , and hopes that the safety of the lives and property of all foreigners working in south africa will receive the ample assurance of local law and citizens . 
since the beginning of 2006 , there have already been 4 chinese citizens that have been murdered in south africa . the chinese world has expressed extensive concern over this . 
china 's ministry of foreign affairs has already put forward discussion of this to south african parties , and warned chinese citizens traveling in south africa to further strengthen their safety and defense knowledge . overseas compatriots should stick together and coordinate with police to jointly crush criminal behavior . 
" we express the most sincere condolences and mourning to the families of those murdered . " 
koloane said , " we feel apologetic because of this . please allow the people of china to believe that the south african government is currently seriously investigating every case that involves china . " 
according to the statement of the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have already successfully broken the case of chinese fujian female chen jianqing 's murder on february 5 , and one suspect is already arrested . 
at present the police are pursuing another suspect . 
also according to the south african embassy in china , a criminal wanted as a suspect in the january shooting of a hong kong businessman has already been arrested by south african police , and the belongings of the murdered person have already been retrieved . 
according to the statements from assistant director of tourism manqoba nyembezi of the south african embassy , the embassy sent out over 2000 visas for travel to south africa by chinese in the first 15 days of this year alone . 
also , according to china 's official statistical data , in 2005 south africa continued to keep china as south africa 's largest trading partner . 
the volume of bilateral trade reached 7.27 billion usd , a year on year growth of 23 % . 
however , personnel in the tourism field believe that the chinese citizen murders that happened in 2004 will have a clear effect on the number of chinese going to south africa to travel . 
according to the statistics of the south african tourism bureau , the first half of 2005 saw 20,331 chinese tourists travel to south africa , a drop of 14.9 % with that of the year before . 
at present there are around 200,000 chinese that live in south africa , spread throughout south africa 's cities , towns , and villages . 
analysts believe that the disparity between rich and poor in south africa is great , the level of unemployment high , guns are everywhere , and there is no deterrence from a death penalty ; thus the crime rate is high . 
because many chinese do not understand english but keep cash on their persons and at home , they more easily become targets for criminals looking for money .
