( international ) us service industry 's growth still lags behind manufacturing industry 
according to the standards set by the association of supply administration , a service industry index of above 50 represents that the industry is expanding , while an index of under 50 represents that the industry is shrinking . 
according to another report issued by the association of supply administration on 2 nd this month , the us manufacturing industry index rose sharply in december to the highest point in 20 years . 
this shows that the growth of us service industry is still lagging behind that of the manufacturing industry . 
the growth of manufacturing industry is helpful to creating more jobs and accelerating economic growth , but the growth of service industry will play an even bigger role in reducing unemployment and accelerating economic growth . 
saarc summit closes as hope of india @-@ pakistan relations thawing appears 
at the closing ceremony of the 12 th south asian association regional cooperation ( saarc ) , bangladesh prime minister ms. zia pointed out : " this summit is an important dividing line to strengthen the south asian regional cooperation . " 
indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf held their first talks in a sideline meeting of the summit since the two countries were at the verge of a nuclear war in 2002 . 
the enmity between the two saarc powers has hindered the regional development . leaders attending the summit have been encouraged by the peace momentum obviously promoted by the historic talks between india and pakistan . 
pakistani military analyst masoud told afp : " i think there is a clear change in india and pakistan 's stands and the two countries are moving forward to a peace process . " 
formally announcing the close of the summit , pakistani prime minister jamali spoke highly of the important agreements on anti @-@ terrorism , poverty alleviation and the establishment of a free trade zone beginning from 2006 . 
he praised the summit meeting as " injecting new vitalities to the regional cooperation " . 
( international ) china and albania sign economic and technological cooperation agreement 
under the agreement , china will provide albania a free aid package worth 15 million yuan , which will be used in economic and technological cooperation projects agreed by the two governments or the chinese side will provide albania with ordinary supplies . 
following the signing ceremony , hajdaraga expressed his thanks to the chinese government for the free aid and best wishes to the chinese people in the spring festival . 
he said that the signing of the agreement had demonstrated the sino @-@ albanian friendship and the close cooperation in all fields . 
the friendly and cooperative ties based on mutual trust between the two countries will be further strengthened in the future . 
tian changchun said that china offered free aid to albania to show that the chinese government and its people are friendly to the albanian government and its people , and it also demonstrated the traditional friendship and cooperation between china and albania . 
since the visit of a security council delegation to six countries in west africa at the end of last june , inspiring changes have taken place in the overall situation in the region in spite of ups and downs in the situation in a small number of countries . 
it 's also pleasing that with the deployment of the un mission in liberia , liberia is gradually getting out the shadow following a long @-@ standing war and is on a track of reconstruction . 
the political process in guinea @-@ bissau has also made positive progress . the transitional government has promised to hold legislative election in march this year . 
we are expecting the security council to make a decision at an earlier possible date . 
the secretariat , the economic community of west african states and parties concerned , from a regional perspective , are also making great efforts to settle the issues concerning small weapons , mercenaries , child soldiers and cross border . 
( international ) arab league secretary @-@ general calls on us not to impose " democracy " on middle east 
xinhua news agency report of january 21 from geneva - secretary @-@ general of the league of arab states ( the arab league ) , moussa , on 21 st called on the united states to discuss democracy with arab countries instead of imposing democracy on the middle east region . 
speaking in an interview during the world economic forum annual meeting in davos , switzerland , moussa said : " if they ( american people ) want to realize democracy in the middle east , they 'd better keep their promise to bring democracy to iraq first . " 
he said that the arab league was america 's best partner to discuss democratic reform in the middle east . 
" once you raise your point of view and are willing to listen to our views , we can talk about any ideas . " 
" we don't oppose democracy but democracy is not an action or order for immediate execution . " 
moussa pointed out that the us government had so far failed to convince people that the occupation of iraq would bring " democracy " to the country . 
" they said that they went to iraq to show us a democratic model to follow . " 
" but so far , we haven't seen anything . " 
although there is no official announcement of the result of georgia 's presidential election on 4 th , a victory by the national movement party leader saakashvili , who is a candidate recommended by the right @-@ wing party alliance , is inevitable . 
georgia 's central election committee announced on 7 th that based on 89 % votes already counted , more than 95 % voters supported saakashvili . 
some heads of states of the commonwealth of independent states have sent congratulatory telegraphs to the young politician . 
in fact , as early as on the night of the election , saakashvili had already announced his victory . 
he claimed that the result was the " victory of the people " and said that georgia would take quick moves to create a new future . 
when interviewed by news medias , many voters said that voting for saakashvili meant choosing " new hopes " . 
even former president shevardnadz , who was forced to step down , also expressed his support to his former political opponent , praising him as " young , energetic and well educated " . 
while placing hopes on saakashvili , people have also noticed that after the resignation of shevardnadz , no great changes have taken place in the situation of georgia . 
this is to say that the newly @-@ elected president will still have to face the old problems . 
a huge population and underdevelopment are china 's two national conditions . 
this is what the chinese leaders must keep in mind at any time . 
to deal with the problems of its 1.3 billion people , china can depend on no one but itself . 
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have achieved a lot in construction but have taken some tortuous paths and lost some opportunities at the same time . 
since the reform and opening up in 1978 , we have finally found a right path to develop ourselves . 
this is : the chinese people will independently build socialism with chinese characteristics . 
the pith of the road is to motivate all positive factors to emancipate and develop the productive forces , and respect and safeguard the chinese people 's freedom in pursuit for well @-@ being . 
china 's reform and opening up moved from rural to urban areas and from economic sectors to political , cultural and social sectors . 
according to statistics , young people who commit suicide are mostly aged between 15 and 19 , but there are still some aged between 10 and 14 . 
academic pressure and failing to meet expectations are certainly topics that parents and children should communicate with each other . 
academic pressure is an inevitable burden for local students . the pressure sometimes comes from themselves but in many occasions , it is imposed on the children by their parents . 
parents have high expectation for their children 's good academic performance and often compare them with other children , requiring them to try to become the top students , which will certainly bring much pressure . however , the communication channels behind the pressure are the real thermometer to measure the intimate relationship between parents and their children . 
it is reported that many young students who need guidance are forced by their parents ' high expectation to a desperate position and get psychological troubles . 
singapore 's success and rapid development have made parents feel that their children 's current material condition is much better than that of their own in the past , so they cannot help believing that their children should perform better than they did . 
in many occasions , parents have forgotten the fact that when they were in their childhood , their performances in various fields might not be , in fact , very excellent , either . 
the iraqi temporary governing council and the us occupation authority have recently signed an agreement , announcing a timetable for returning power to iraq in stages by next june . 
the iraqi people have a cold response . the us media even believe that " this is a big gamble " . 
all in all , people have cast doubts on it and would rather wait and see . 
it 's not without reason that the international community has great doubts on it . 
because people have noticed that the us is not willing to hand over the power back to iraq . the handover will be incomplete and is sure to leave many problems . 
firstly , members of the transitional government to be set up next may are not directly elected by the iraqi people , instead they will be elected by the " transitional national representative congress " to be elected by the election committees in 18 provinces . 
it is hard to clear the doubt of being controlled by the us . its legitimacy will also be doubted . 
secondly , after announcing the power transfer , the us army will not withdraw . the only change will be from the original " military occupation " to " military presence " . 
bush narrowly saves free trade zone plan in american summit 
( afp report from monterrey , january 13 ) us president bush 's ambitious plan to push forward the establishment of the american free trade zone next year won narrow support from leaders of other 33 countries at today 's american summit . 
however , countries attending the summit differed in how the west hemisphere deals with the increasingly serious problem of poverty . the united states also failed to include an anti @-@ graft article in the final communique . 
the american free trade zone covers areas from alaska in the north to argentina in the south , which is called the largest free trade zone in the world , with a market population of around 800 million and total gdp of 13 trillion us dollars . 
however , argentine president kirchner made remarks to attack the us plan at the end of the two @-@ day summit , saying the problems in america could not be solved only with the establishment of the free trade zone . 
when the theory of " preemptive strike " was first raised , some us politicians asked the question : " what will we do if other countries follow the us ? " 
as expected , over the past two years , more and more countries are claiming to launch " preemptive strike " . the squad advocating " preemptive strike " is getting bigger and bigger . 
this is a new trend that is worth paying attention to and study . 
within the month when bush proposed the strategy of " preemptive strike " , australian prime minister howard was the first to stand out to show his support . 
he said that once it got hard evidence that terrorists would launch attacks against australia , the country would take the " preemptive strike " strategy to launch military operations in neighboring countries . 
he even proposed to add the principle of " preemptive strike " into the un charter , believing that it was necessary to amend the un charter to empower various states the right of taking " preemptive strike " to crack down on terrorists or nations supporting terrorism . 
following the war in iraq , japan 's calls for the " preemptive strike " strategy are getting even louder . 
pakistani president musharraf wins votes of confidence in senate and house 
information minister rashid told afp reporters : " musharraf has won a majority votes in the parliament . 
no parliament members voted against him . " 
among the 342 seats in the house , 191 members voted for musharraf . the parliament 's islamic fundamentalist members abstained from voting while opposition parties boycotted the controversial votes of confidence . 
musharraf has made concessions to six islamic party alliances to give up the post of the army 's general commander and the dissolution of the parliament should be approved by the supreme court within one month . 
at the 100 @-@ seat senate , 56 senators voted for musharraf while 42 islamic fundamentalist and opposition members either abstained or boycotted the voting . 
musharraf took over the office after a coup in october 1999 and since then has always refused to step down . 
private enterprises outnumber state @-@ owned @/@ controlled enterprises in guangdong for the first time 
according to statistics , by the end of 2003 the whole province had 690,000 various kinds of enterprises ( including domestic , private and foreign investment firms ) , up 0.59 % from the end of the year before .

continuous labor decrease to pound economic production in eu and japan 
in contrast , the sufficient labor supply in developing countries such as india and china will help promote the economic development . 
executive president of watson wyatt worldwide , shamans , said : " labor 's growth rate and the productive forces will decide the economic output . 
in countries where there is a huge shortage of labor , the supply of goods and labor may not satisfy the demand and the living standards . " 
the statement also warned that " japan 's proportion will shrink to 4 % from 8 % . " 
the consultants and distinguished guests attending the meeting include senior leaders of famous multinational corporations , renowned international economists and experienced experts as well as scholars . 
i 've deeply felt the consultants ' sincere spirit of cooperation and positive and practical attitude . 
to give a full play of our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom is not only helpful to planning and promoting guangdong 's development , but also to promoting our cooperation and development in all fields . 
i have been looking forward to the " 2003 international consultancy conference on guangdong 's economic development " to listen to your valuable advice on guangdong 's economic and social development . 
today , we meet here for one common goal : to strengthen cooperation and exchanges , expand the space for development , inject vitality to guangdong 's economic and social development and to create opportunities for your own development . 
china 's accession into the wto symbolizes a new stage of its opening up . we are now participating in the international competitions more extensively , in broader fields and at a higher level . 
guangdong is a province in the chinese mainland with a most overseas @-@ oriented economy and it has first faced the development opportunities and grim challenges ever seen . 
guangdong people are dedicated to the full construction of a better @-@ off society and speeding up the modernization drive , which will create more development opportunities and space for all friends . 
guangdong 's economy , which is full of vitality and broad prospect , is moving to a higher level with a strong momentum . 
priest brings government to court over school ban on aids children 
despite of the fact that there are 2.5 million people who are estimated to carry aids virus , aids and the virus are still a taboo topic in kenya . 
d'agostino has appealed for a court ruling to force the public schools to accept children without asking them if they are hiv carriers or not . 
kenya 's ministry of education , through its lawyer gacivih , said it was unaware of such discrimination but it understood the schools . 
gacivih said that the education ministry was willing to settle the dispute through talks with the nyumbani orphanage located in the northwestern outskirts of nairobi . 
judge koome has ordered the two sides to hold discussions on the issue and report the result back tomorrow . 
( international ) wto brings the " byrd subsidy " dispute to arbitration 
the lawsuit seeking for sanctions was raised following the us failure to abolish the byrd amendment before a deadline set by the wto . 
the us move has drawn opposition from its major trade partners , including the eu and japan . 
the wto issued a final ruling in january 2003 that the amendment went against world trade rules and asked the united states to abolish it before december 27 th that year . 
however , the united states did not follow the wto ruling . 
however , the united states had raised questions about the level of the sanction and the legality of the lawsuit . 
the second round of six @-@ party talks on the nuclear issue in the korean peninsular has come to an end as what people have generally expected . 
during the talks , the parties concerned have come into contact with and sounded one another about the peripheral issues of the korean peninsula nuclear crisis and have reached common ground on issues of holding the third round of talks by the end of june this year and the establishment of a working team . 
the two leading roles , north korea and the us , have not made any compromise and the two sides ' basic stances are not changed . 
however , what catches attention is that the us has shown an attitude that it was not eager to settle the issue and has left an impression of " dilatoriness " . 
the us strategy is closely linked to the new development of the current international situation and the interests it is seeking in such new developments . 
gdp is a key macro economic indicator widely used in the world . 
it is important to keep the growth of gdp during our country 's modernization drive . 
we need to keep a fast economic growth momentum when taking consideration the fact alone that one percentage increase in gdp will result in more than 800,000 additional jobs . 
to realize the great target of the full construction of a better @-@ off society and the third @-@ stage strategic goal in the modernization drive will , to a great extent , depend on a fast and sustainable growth of gdp . 
however , we should notice that the gdp indicator has its defects . 
for example , it is not easy to correctly reflect the quality and structure of economic growth and the level of people 's actual social welfare benefits . it also cannot correctly measure social distribution and justice . 
on the other hand , gdp is also not the sole measurement . 
therefore , we should look at the gdp calculation system in a scientific spirit and with scientific attitudes and views . gdp 's position in the overall economic and social development should be properly treated . 
while it is necessary to keep a certain growth rate , we shall not lay too much emphasis on or unduly or painstakingly pursue growth rate . 
( international ) airbus ' deliveries surpass boeing 's for the first time 
airbus ' aircraft delivery last year was slightly more than the 303 in 2003 . 
the company predicted that this year 's market would remain sluggish so its delivery would be " nearly 300 planes " . 
the us boeing company announced early this month that its delivery last year was 281 . this year 's delivery is expected to reach between 275 and 290 . 
in 2003 , airbus ' aircraft delivery rose to 52 % in the global market share while its market shares were 38 % and 44 % in 2001 and 2002 respectively . 
last year , airbus received 284 orders worth a total of 32.8 billion us dollars ; excluding the 30 cancellations , it had 254 actual orders , holding a 52 % global market share . 
in any country , the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts are supposed to be the symbol of justice and fairness and also are important systems to safeguard social stability . 
unfortunately , the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts have become a symbol of corruption in china . 
a recent report issued by the national audit administration said an investigation of the financial affairs of police departments in 26 provinces and cities showed that a total of 16.5 billion yuan had been abused by police departments around the country in violation of rules . 
the confidence crisis in the public security organs , procuratorial organs and people 's courts has come out into the open . 
the incidents of liu yong and sun zhigang and the recent " bmw " incident in heilongjiang have all reflected such deep distrust . 
the incident of " bmw " is more typical . 
people have paid more attention to the issue than to the " sars " even during the period of the " sars " epidemic . 
in fact , what people were paying attention to was not the " bmw " incident itself , instead they have expressed their distrust of the whole legal system . 
the relevant departments were very clear about this so they ordered a blackout of the media . 
however , the problem is still there . 
( international ) two black boxes of crashed plane found in red sea 
both black boxes were found over 1,000 meters under the water , with the two lying 30 meters apart . 
head of the egyptian accident investigation commission , shaker qelada , said that the first black box contained various kinds of technical statistics before the crash , and that the black box would be " decoded and analyzed " by the laboratory of egypt 's ministry of civil aviation . 
although the black box had been severely damaged looking from its outer appearance , qelada said that it remained in " good condition " . 
the two so @-@ called black boxes of the plane are actually light yellow in color . 
according to their design , they can send out signals for 30 days after falling into the 6,000 -@ meter @-@ deep seabed to enable rescuers to identify their locations and to find them . 
the crashed plane in the red sea belongs to the egyptian private flash airlines . 
the boeing 737 plane crashed in the red sea shortly after taking off from the egyptian tourism resort sharm el @-@ sheikh on 3 rd of this month , killing 148 people , including 134 french , 1 moroccan and 13 egyptian crew members . 
egyptian and french experts said that the air crash was caused by technical problems instead of terrorist attacks or explosions . the recovery of the two black boxes will help find the cause . 
democratic party accuses bush of creating new axis of evils 
( afp report from washington d.c. , january 21 ) the us opposition democratic party on the night of 20 th accused president bush of leading the united states to isolation from the world . it also accused bush 's policy of creating a new " axis of evils " . 
house democrat leader pelosi lashed out at the casualties and cost of money during the war against iraq last year during a democrats ' review of the president 's state of the union speech . 
the democratic party attacked bush severely as it is the year of us presidential election ( us presidential election starts on november 2 this year ) . 
one of democrat 's major presidential nominees , clark , said that bush had created his own " axis of evils " . 
bush created the phrase , axis of evils , in his state of the union two years ago to refer to some countries posing threats to the united states . 
clark said : " that is the axis of an accountant policy threatening our future , a foreign policy threatening our security and internal policies that will be deadly to families . " 
economic development and poverty elimination are the basic prerequisites for achieving sustainable development . 
sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and overall social development . 
without addressing the issue of living , development is out of the question , let alone any sustainable development . 
accelerating economic development and making great efforts to eliminate poverty are the only ways for developing countries to move towards sustainable development . 
without addressing of the issue of poverty in developing countries , the development in developed countries will also be hard to sustain . 
proper use of resources and protection of the environment are a must for realizing sustainable development . 
development could not be sustained at the cost of wasting resources and damaging the environment . 
only by sticking to the road of a recycled economy based on the most efficient use of resources and environmental protection , can a sustainable development be realized . 
the overall social progress and improvement of people 's living standard and quality are the ultimate objectives of sustainable development . 
seven years after nixon visited china and the announcement of the sino @-@ american shanghai communiqu¨¦ , the carter administration accepted the chinese stance on the taiwan issue and realized the establishment of sino @-@ american diplomatic ties . 
this incident and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states opened a new chapter in sino @-@ american relations . 
during early stages of the regan administration , china and the us had severe conflicts over the taiwan issue . 
following arduous negotiations , the two governments issued the renowned 8.17 communiqu¨¦ in 1982 , reaching agreement on phasing down the weapon sales to taiwan . 
the shanghai communiqu¨¦ , the sino @-@ american communiqu¨¦ on establishing diplomatic relations and the 8.17 communiqu¨¦ serve as the political cornerstones of sino @-@ american ties . 
during the 10 years after the establishment of diplomatic ties , in spite of the two countries ' occasional conflicts over the taiwan issue , sino @-@ american ties remained stable in general and exchanges and cooperation in all fields saw a gradual increase . 
in the 1980 s and the beginning of 1990 s in the 20 th century , the cold war came to an end as east europe experienced dramatic changes and the soviet union dissolved . the international situation underwent the most profound changes since the second world war . 
the united states took the lead in imposing sanctions on china and announced to sell 150 f @-@ 16 fighter jets to taiwan . it linked the human rights issue with the most favored nation treatment and allowed lee teng @-@ hui to visit the us , which brought sino @-@ american relations to the all @-@ time low . 
with china 's rapid economic development , china 's international status is on a rise . 
more and more american people have realized that the improvement and development of sino @-@ american relations is in the interest of the us and china . 
as expected , malaysian prime minister abdullah announced the dissolution of the parliament the day before yesterday . a new election will be held in the near future . 
it has only been four months since abdullah took over from mahathir last november . 
despite of this , he still decided to dissolve the parliament and hold an earlier election . 
there is no doubt that abdullah 's decision to hold a blitz election has shown that he has made an overall appraisal of the domestic political situation . 
malaysia is seeing a good economic performance now and there are no topics for the opposition parties to make use of . 
meanwhile , he has called to improve the efficiency of public services , which is also an inspiring move . 
( international ) us rescue team denies political intentions involved in aiding iran 
catlin pointed out that the organization of the us rescue team had " nothing to do with politics " . the united states had offered similar humanitarian aids to iran before . 
he said that the rescue team consisted of 84 members , which had set up an urban rescue squad and a field hospital in the bam region and sent several other groups to conduct evaluation of housing damages in the city . 
they have also brought relief materials such as plastic sheets and tents . 
when asked how long the us rescue team would stay in bam , catlin said : " we will stay as long as the host ( the iranian government ) allows . " 
catlin also said that the us rescue team 's activities in bam were free and no iranian police offered them protection or followed them . 
in addition , he said that the iranian government 's reaction to the earthquake and its ability of handling of it was " excellent and remarkable " . 
the us international development agency is affiliated with the international development cooperation agency , which is under the us state department . 
since the united states and iran severed diplomatic ties in 1980 , the two sides have not resumed normal relations . 
the united states currently still regards iran as " a state supporting terrorism " and one of the " axis of evils " . 
the untied states sent the rescue team to iran at the invitation of the iranian ambassador to the un . 
however , the previous challenges not only lay in funding the public houses , private houses also faced a big test . 
after the outbreak of 1997 financial crisis , the capital foams burst , leading to a sharp decline of housing prices by 70 % and severely hitting the owners . it was also the main cause for the deterioration of deflation over the past five years . 
now the economy is recovering . we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sustainable and stable development of the housing market . 
a healthy housing market is indeed of great importance to hong kong 's economic recovery . 
we are also dedicated to protecting and improving the living environment . 
our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development to adopt better urban designs , strengthen the protection of hong kong 's natural and historical scenic spots and improve the living environment . 
we will pay more attention to the issue of the overall environment . 
the lesson of last year 's outbreak of sars epidemic in hong kong has reminded us to make efforts to create a cleaner and healthier living environment . 
we are intensifying our efforts to beautify the environment , plant more trees and build more parks and recreational facilities for use by the residents . 
education is the cornerstone of modern civilization . 
to raise the quality of the nationals and to improve the state 's comprehensive strength , education must be greatly developed . 
rural education has a widespread influence and concerns the rural economy and the overall social development . 
since the reforms and opening up , great and substantial changes have taken place in our country 's rural areas , which are highly attributable to the development of education , especially the rural education . 
the adoption of the household contract responsibility system with remuneration linked to output in rural areas has greatly emancipated the productive forces . 
the emergence of the world 's new scientific and technological revolution and the drive for building a better @-@ off society have raised a higher demand on the rural population with respect to the quality in such areas as science and technology , culture , ideology and ethics . 
without the comprehensive " nine @-@ year compulsory education " and the overall improvement of the farmers ' quality , the target of a fully better @-@ off society is hard to reach . 
we must fully understand the basic , leading and overall role of rural education in the full construction of a better @-@ off society . 
ruling does not mean to enjoy power but to shoulder more responsibility . 
for a long period of time , the democratic progressive party has been playing a role of " shadow government " in expanding taiwan 's diplomatic efforts and has achieved excellent results . 
i will assume the post of chairman of " asian free democratic alliance " next march . i expect to use the capacity as a leader of an international organization to create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community . 
in addition , since the democratic progressive party became a formal member of " the international free alliance " last year , it has been actively engaged in relevant affairs of the organization . 
apart from the fact that it has designated a human right commissioner in the headquarters ' secretariat in london , it will cooperate with other member parties in holding relevant seminars on political reforms in central and south america and in europe . 
shenzhen imposes sars quarantine on drivers at entry @/@ exit ports 
the bureau calls on relevant units and drivers going through the ports to offer active cooperation to get the job well done so as to prevent the spreading of sars epidemic through shenzhen 's ports to protect people 's health . 
the meeting discussed issues on iraq 's politics , humanitarian , and appointment of a un special envoy to iraq . the three sides have candidly exchanged ideas on the issues . 
as the us and britain 's power transfer plan is facing oppositions , it will naturally attract attentions to whether and how the un will interfere in iraq 's reconstruction . 
since the us announced the end of major wars in iraq in early may last year , iraq has seen a continuous turbulent situation . attacks against the occupation come one after another , resulting in heavy casualties and great chaos . 
although former iraqi president saddam was arrested on december 13 last year , the us has had little time to cheer because the security situation did not see any improvement and the occupation authority found itself bogged down in difficulties as opposition activities intensified . 
on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab nations have called on foreign troops to withdraw from iraq , hand over the power to the iraqi people and let them rule their own country . 
meanwhile , the us and britain are seeking to reconstruct the iraqi regime according to their wills , on the basis of which they will gradually withdraw from the mire in a " decent " way . 
therefore , the way and process of power transfer have become the current focus of the iraqi issue . 
however , the shiite muslims , which are the majority of the population , have stressed that a direct national election should be held to show a true and fair power transfer to iraq . 
us expected to release hundreds of iraqi prisoners 
pachachi praised the measures taken by the occupation alliance , saying this was achieved by the executive consultancy conference 's effective lobbying . 
pachachi told reporters : " the executive consultancy conference has long been engaged in promoting the reconciliation spirit among the iraqi people . to this end , we have asked the alliance to review the issue of prisoners . " 
a spokesman , who asked not be named , from the occupation alliance said later that a total of 506 prisoners were expected to be freed in the next few weeks . 
bremer told reporters in his short speech : " the alliance will release the first 100 prisoners tomorrow . " 
bremer made the reconciliatory move when the occupation alliance was trying to appease the anger of the sunni muslims that hussein belonged to . 
hussein has been arrested after being at large for eight months . 
bremer said : " tyrant hussein is now in custody , most of whose followers have either been killed or arrested . it is time for the reconciliation . " 
the condition for the prisoners to be freed is " the renouncement of violence " and to find a guarantor from the community , religious or tribal groups , who should also take the responsibility of taking care of the freed people 's behaviors . 
bremer pointed out those to be freed were neither involved in violence or other deadly attacks against the us army nor committed criminal or anti @-@ humanity crimes . 
bremer said that those to be freed had " made mistakes but they have come to realize their errors " and " we are ready to offer some of them new opportunities . " 
burundi president : former rebels to join military command 
former rebel group " the forces for the defense of democracy " has welcomed the move , praising it as an " important step " towards the establishment of a new army . 
ndayizeye said : " parties that signed the agreement ( ceasefire agreement of november 2003 ) must complete the resettlement of the fighters by no later than january 5 . " 
he added that the chief of staff conference that included former rebel leaders must get ready before january 7 . 
this move is mainly related to the largest rebel group , " the forces for the defense of democracy " , among the six rebel organizations , which signed the peace agreement . 
the 7 th rebel group " the national liberation forces " refused to sign the agreement . 
about 300,000 people have been killed since the civil war broke out between the hutu rebels and the tutsi government troops in 1993 . 
a hot topic has been debated in europe recently : whether the " big three " meeting of german chancellor schroeder , french president chirac and british prime minister blair is gradually moving towards a mechanism . 
the public has called the " big three " of germany , france and britain europe 's " new troika " , with their relations called " new triangle " ties . 
looking back to europe 's history over the past 100 years , the german , french and british triangle ties are basically characterized by the british and french alliance containing or resisting germany . 
the two world wars are the proofs . 
during the cold war , east and west germanys were respectively bound up into the warsaw treaty organization and the nato . 
however , with the re @-@ start of the " germany @-@ france axis " over the past years and fierce clashes between the unipolarization and multipolarization in the world , the eu has been split over the issue of iraq . 
the " old europe " represented by germany and france and the " new europe " represented by britain and poland took completely different stances on the issue of the iraqi war . 
and the split has come at a point when the eu is about to undergo its largest expansion in history . 
asia has splendid cultures with a long history . the yellow river and yangtze river valleys , the indian river and the ganga river valleys as well as the tigris and euphrates river valleys are famous birthplaces of human civilizations . 
during the long course of history , the asian people have written a brilliant page in the development of human civilizations . 
since the modern times , asia has experienced many vicissitudes and suffered a lot of hardships . the peoples of various countries have made unremitting efforts in seeking emancipation and development and made great achievements . 
however , asia has a long way to go before realizing its re @-@ emergence and rejuvenation . 
strengthening cooperation , promoting development and attaining common wins is the only way for asia to realize its re @-@ emergence and rejuvenation and is also in the basic interests of the asian people . 
under the new circumstances in the new century , asia 's development faces new opportunities . 
peace and development remain the theme of the present era . the overall peaceful international environment has offered favorable external conditions for asia 's development . 
with abundant natural resources and a huge market , asia is a region with strongest economic vitality in today 's world and has great development potential .

an old arabian saying goes like this : " one day of chaos is more fearful than a thousand years of tyranny . " 
is this what currently worries northeastern asian countries ? 
i think the answer is perhaps affirmative . 
the attitudes of the regional countries towards these policies are the focus of this investigation . 
in addition , the investigation also analyzes the threats posed by north korea 's nuclear weapon program on the basis of people 's opinions about the possibility of a nuclear attack and its possible damages as well as their fears in north korea 's neighboring countries . 
china and russia believe that there is little or very little possibility that north korea will use nuclear weapons while people in japan and south korea think there is a great threat . 
all the northeastern asian countries support maintaining exchanges with north korea . 
japan supports containment . other countries also believe that under certain circumstance , the policy of containment is acceptable .

however , as i 've told the colleagues in the government who have also been affected by the decision , i hope all of you will first think about the public interests , understand relevant situations and be more patient during this period of time . 
the postponement of construction of the new legislative council office building at tianmajian will help ease the government 's financial burden over the coming few years . it is in the interests of the public and will be accepted by the public . 
the government will restart the new legislative council office building construction project in tianmajian when the public financial situation sees some improvement . that is what we are planning to do .

this has reminded us that in the first half of the 20 th century , keynesian advised president roosevelt to adopt a deficit policy to spur the economy while raising foreign loans to deal with the financial deficits . 
the move has played an important role in accelerating the " effective demands " to settle the emergency of an economic crisis . 
however , people have noticed that several previous us administrations have tended to regard it as a " panacea " . 
however , since president regan advocated a tax cut @-@ off and military build @-@ up in 1980 s of the 20 th century , us financial deficits have been on a gradual rise and it has eventually become the largest debtor country .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet 
xinhua news agency , ramallah , february 9 ( international observation ) . hamas seeks breakthrough in organization of its cabinet 
xinhua news agency reporters : wang hao and huang min 
how the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) draws the blueprint for its first government after it won the legislative committee election has become the focus that the international community is currently paying attention to . 
what kind of a new policy hamas is going to carry out will directly affect the next appropriate policy direction of every party concerned in the peace process . 
at the same time , the boycott attitude of the united states and israel has made the prospect of the hamas government more uncertain . 
currently , all the parties in palestine are consulting each other tensely , and actively looking for breakthroughs in difficulties and sensitive aspects in future development of the cabinet organization . 
( subtitle ) who will be selected to take the position of prime minister ? 
some outsiders worry that a " hamas prime minister " might have disagreements with abbas , the current supreme leader , after hamas wins the right to organize its cabinet . 
moreover , a hamas leader , mushir , who is visiting egypt , stressed that a new palestinian government established by hamas leadership will not acknowledge israel . this strong signal has also raised more international concerns . 
the united states and israel have clearly stated that they do not accept a hamas government that controls real power , and threatened to stop their economic aid to palestine and suspend transferring tax income to the palestinian side . 
however , these things do not hinder hamas from adjusting its strategy flexibly . selection of an independent candidate is one compromise . 
as it has been reported , to win maximum acknowledgement internationally , the hamas leaders from home and abroad who gathered in egypt a few days ago , had decided to select jamal al @-@ khudairi , an independent person who is the chair of the board of gaza islamic university , to be the new prime minister . 
this move has not been responded to by related parties . 
hussein , a palestinian analyst , said that no matter who is selected as the prime minister , the most important thing is to soften the " strong " attitude of hamas as much as possible on the selection of the candidate for prime minister , and only in this way can it assure the success of the cabinet organization . 
( subtitle ) how to allocate power 
the biggest challenge for hamas in organizing its cabinet is that it lacks sufficient administrative experience from the perspective of its internal capabilities . 
hamas suggested to establish a " political partnership " with fatah to organize a national coalition government after the election , but fatah has not actively responded to it so far . 
inside fatah , there are now different opinions on whether it should join the cabinet ; some think it should join the new government to play a role in it ; some refuse the invitation from hamas and would rather become an " active opposition " in the legislative committee . 
a well @-@ informed source pointed out that fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government after abbas 's persuasion . 
even so , fatah will bargain with hamas on the allocation of cabinet positions . 
moreover , another path is to establish a cabinet that is out of the framework of the legislative committee and free of partisan leanings . 
as it has been reported , hamas has also designed a pure technocratic government , but the concrete name list of the government is unknown . 
because of the attitude of the united states and israel , a technocratic government is a cabinet organization method that can reduce external pressure . 
according to regulations of the palestinian " essential law , " nomination of the prime minister and the cabinet organization work will be completed within 3 to 5 weeks after a new legislative committee assumes office on the 16 th of this month . 
( subtitle ) where does the armed wing go ? 
another difficult issue for organization of a new government is the weapons in the hands of hamas . 
the attitude of the united states and israel is very strong , and they firmly request that hamas give up violence , and refuse its joining the government with its weapons . 
hamas leader mushir stressed on the 9 th that the armed resistance is the " strategic choice " of the organization . 
the armed wing issue includes two aspects of weapons ' legitimacy and ownership and control of armed wings . 
hamas used to suggest integrating military wings of all factions into a " people 's army " under the palestinian national authority , but it has not received broad responses , and has even been criticized by the palestinian islamic organization ( jihad ) . 
palestine currently has more than 60,000 personnel in security organizations , and most of them come from the fatah camp . 
moreover , fatah has some armed wings and keeps loose organizational relations with them , such as the " al @-@ aqsa martyr brigades " and " fatah hawks , " etc. 
hamas , responsible for the cabinet organization , must make an agreement with abbas on how to control those self @-@ governed armed wings and reasonably allocate security and administrative power . 
as local media reported , abbas tends to control security and intelligence troops ; organizations such as the police and civilian defense can be administrated by the internal affairs ministry of a new government . 
however , all parties concerned are still consulting each other on this sensitive issue , and have not produced any results . 
accident occurred on jingha highway , some parts of road closed because of leaked waste oil 
as has been learned , the tank of the truck was loaded with waste oil that was a product of coke production . 
since the waste oil is very sticky , and to prevent the risk of sparks produced by passing vehicles , a relevant department has closed the road around the accident scene . 
some parts of the highway from harbin to shuangcheng have been closed , and many vehicles have to take a detour . 
a relevant department is clearing up the scene at present , and the cause of the accident is being investigated . 
( overseas affairs about china ) developmental trend of economic and trade relations between china and myanmar good , has great potential 
counselor tang hai said that the mutual visits maintained by high @-@ level leaders of the two countries have vigorously promoted development of economic and trade cooperation and relations between the two countries . 
there were 33 economic and trade cooperation agreement documents signed by both sides during the period of mutual visits by high @-@ level officials in 2004 , and most of them are being implemented and practiced .

in last year 's bilateral trade , the total trade amount between yunnan in china and myanmar ( contains the border trade ) was 0.63 billion usd , and increased 14.6 % compared with that of last year . 
since china 's enterprises conduct projects and business in myanmar , it has promoted export of various sets of chinese mechanical and electrical products , and myanmar has become one of the important markets for export of various sets of chinese equipments and mechanical and electrical products . 
based on the statistics of china 's customs , in the past five to six years , the export amount of chinese mechanical and electrical products has been around 45 % of the total amount of chinese exports to myanmar . 
counselor tang also said that since myanmar has rich resources , china 's enterprises have started to invest in resources development projects such as petroleum oil , natural gas , nickel and copper mines , etc. ; therefore , the potential for development of economic and trade cooperation and relations between china and myanmar is very great . 
he hopes that china 's enterprises have their long @-@ term vision , learn how to avoid risks , carefully make decisions , establish good images for enterprises , and win honors for china by completing projects on time , with quality and quantity guarantees , after winning bids for projects . 
it is predicted that both sides will sign several economic and trade agreement documents during his visit . 
high @-@ definition tvs have gradually become mainstream in united states 
the just @-@ ended us " super bowl , " a us type of football game , has become a warm @-@ up competition for us broadcasters to greet the age of high @-@ definition tv . 
as the financial times reported a few days ago , the us congress has recently passed a bill , and regulates that us broadcasters must completely stop broadcasting current analog tv signals and transmit only digital signals by february 17 , 2009 .

minister of south africa , in china , says there are no " organized " criminal activities against chinese citizens in south africa 
he said at the same time that the south african government will make every effort to " strike against all forms of criminal activities . " 
vusi bruce koloane stated that the south african government hopes to " reduce the crime rate to zero , " and wants the life and asset securities of every foreigner who works in south africa to be fully protected by local laws and citizens . 
since 2006 , 4 chinese citizens have been killed , one after another , in south africa , and the chinese world has broadly paid attention to it . 
china 's foreign ministry has contacted the south african side about the matter , and warned chinese citizens who are traveling in south africa to increase their awareness of their security and protection , and to strengthen unity and caring for each other among overseas chinese , and to collaborate with the police to jointly strike against criminal activities . 
" we express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to family members of those victims . "

as the embassy of south africa presented , the south african police have successfully broken a case in which chen jianqing , a woman came from fujian , china , was killed on february 5 in south africa , and have arrested a suspect . 
the police are searching for another suspect at present . 
as the south african embassy in china disclosed , the suspect , who is charged with the gun death of a hong kong businessman in january of this year , has been arrested by the south african police , and the belongings of the victim have been recovered . 
as tourist attache of the south african embassy nian beixi presented , the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas for chinese to go to south africa in the first 15 days of this year . 
based on the statistical data of the chinese government , south africa had maintained its number one status as china 's biggest trade partner in africa in 2005 . 
the bilateral trade amount reached 7.27 billion usd , and increased 23 % compared with that of last year . 
however , people in the tourist industry think that the continuous occurrences of killing chinese citizens in 2004 have apparently affected the number of tourists who visited south africa . 
based on the statistics of the sightseeing bureau of south africa , there were 20,331 chinese tourists who visited south africa in the first half of 2005 , which were reduced 14.9 % compared with that of last year . 
there are about 200,000 chinese who live in south africa at present , and are scattered everywhere in the towns and villages of south africa . 
analysts here think that since there are big gaps between the rich and poor in south african society , and a high unemployment rate , guns are spread everywhere , and no death penalty , the crime rate is still high there . 
because many chinese do not speak english , and they carry cash with them and put cash in their homes , they become easy targets for criminals to attack them for their assets .
