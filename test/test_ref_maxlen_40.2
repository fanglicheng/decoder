( international ) the growth of american service trades still falls behind that of manufacturing industry 
according to the standards of the institute for supply management , the service index higher than 50 represents the expansion of the trades and that lower than 50 signifies contraction . 
in another report released by the institute for supply management on 2 nd this month , the index of american manufacturing industry grew on a large scale in december last year , reaching a record high for 20 years . 
this shows that presently the growth of american service trades still falls behind that of manufacturing industry . 
the growth of manufacturing industry facilitates the creation of jobs and the growth of economy , but the growth of service trades exercises an even more impact on reduction of unemployment and the growth of economy . 
the summit meeting of south asia came to conclusion and the relation between india and pakistan sees the dawn of thawing 
ms. zia , premier of bengal , pointed out at the closing meeting of the 12 th south asian association of regional cooperation ( saarc ) summit that " this summit is a watershed for strengthening south asia regional cooperation . " 
the indian premier vajpayee and the pakistani president musharraf held a talk at the side of the conference hall , the first such talk since the nuclear crisis between the two countries in 2002 . 
the hostility between the 2 powers of saarc has been an obstacle for regional development . the leaders of the participant countries are greatly encouraged by the fact that the historic talk will obviously promote peace . 
the military analyst of pakistan masood said to afp : " i believe thare are clear changes on the positions of india and pakistan . the two countries are marching towards peace process . " 
when the premier of pakistan jamali formally announced the summit closed , he commended the summit on its efforts in fighting against terrorism and poverty and its agreement to set up a free trade region by 2006 .

since the delegation of the security council visited the 6 countries in west africa at the end of last june , inspiring changes have taken place in the general situation of the whole region although one or two countries have experienced some relapses . 
what also inspries us is that , with the disposition of un mission in liberia , liberia is getting rid of the influence of the long @-@ time war and is embarking on the road to restoration and reconstruction . 
guinea @-@ bissau has made headways in its political process and the transitional government has promised to hold legislature election in march this year . 
we are looking forward to the decision of the security council in this regard as soon as possible . 
the secretariat , the west african economic community and other related sides are working hard to settle the problems of small arms , mercenary troops , children soldiers , etc. and they have made progress . 
( international ) secretary general of the league of arab states appeals to us not to impose " democracy " on the middle east 
( xinhua news agency in geneva on january 21 st ) secretary general moussa of the league of arab states urged on us to discuss democracy with the arab countries and not to impose democracy on the middle east on 21 st . 
moussa said , when interviewed by journalists during the world economic forum annual meeting held in davos of switzerland , if they ( americans ) want to achieve democracy in the middle east , they had better keep their promise and bring about democracy first in iraq . 
he said the league of arab states is the best partner for us to talk about democratic reform in the middle east . 
" provided you put forward your ideas and are willing to listen to our view , we can talk about everything . 
we are not opposed to democracy , but democracy is not an act or an order to be carried out immediately . " 
moussa pointed out that the american government has so far failed to convince people that occupying iraq can bring " democracy " to this country . 
" they said their going to iraq is in order to display an imitable example of democracy to us . 
but up till now , we have seen nothing . " 
although the result of the georgian president election held on 4 th has not been made public , the victory of national movement party leader and the candidate jointly recommended by right @-@ wing parties saakashvili is already a foregone conclusion . 
the georgian central election committee announced on 7 th that the statistics of 89 % of ballots shows that 95 % of the voters support saakashvili . 
state heads of some cis countries have already sent congratulation messages to this young statesman . 
in fact on the very night when the election was over , saakashvili already announced himself to be the winner . 
he called the result " a victory of the people " and said the georgia will take prompt action to create new prospects . 
many voters say , when interviewed by news media , that the ballots cast to saakashvili mean the choice of " new hope " . 
even shevardnadze , former president who was compelled to resign , expressed his support for his political opponent , praising him to be " young , vigorous and well educated " . 
while placing hope on him , people also notice that the situation in georgia has not changed much in the 2 months since shevardnadze resigned . 
it may well say that the newly elected president will meet the same old problems . 
great population and under @-@ development are the two state conditions of china . 
this is what the chinese leaders must bear in mind at all times 
to solve the problems of the 1,300 million people , we can depend on none other than ourselves . 
since the people 's republic of china was founded , we have achieved a lot in our construction . but we have taken a roundabout course and lost some opportunities . 
since we initiated reform and opening @-@ up in 1978 , we have finally found at last a right path for our own development . 
in other words , the chinese people should build socialism with chinese characteristics in an independent way . 
the essence of this path is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and development productive forces and respect and guarantee the freedom of the chinese people to pursue happiness . 
the reform and opening @-@ up in china spread from the rural areas to the cities , from the economic realm to the fields of politics , culture and society . 
statistics show that young people who commit suicide are mostly between 15 and 19 years old , and some are the younger between 10 to 14 old . 
pressure from lessons and disappointment from expectation of course belong to the category of communication between children and their parents . 
pressure resulting from going to schools of higher grade is an inevitable burden on children in their development . sometimes the pressure comes from the adolescents themselves and mostly it is imposed on them by their parents . 
parents demand higher academic records and often compare their children with other kids . they demand their children to do even better , which causes great pressure . but persuasion and communication behind the pressure are the thermometer that measures the relationship between kids and parents . 
it is said that many adolescents who need psychiatric help are perplexed simply because the extraordinarily high expectation of their parents has put them into an inescapable corner . 
the success and fast development of singapore make parents feel that their children have far better material conditions and inevitably they think that their kids should excel them in performance . 
normally , parents forget the fact that they might not be very excellent in everything when they were kids . 
a few days ago , the provisional governing council of iraq and the us occupying authorities concluded an agreement in baghdad , announcing a schedule of returning power to iraq by june next year step by step . 
the iraqi public are apathetic in response . the us public opinion even believes " it is a great gamble . " 
in short people half believe and half doubt it . they adopt a " wait @-@ and @-@ see " attitude . 
it is not without reason that the international community is dubious about it . 
because people see that handing over the power is something us has to do , the power transfer can never be complete , which will inevitably leave behind many foreshadowing . 
first , the interim transitional government to be established by may next year will not be directly elected by the iraqi people , but by " the transitional national congress " which will be elected by 18 provincial election committees . 
this can hardly avoid the suspicion that us controls the whole process . its legality will be doubted . 
secondly , us has announced that the us troops will not withdraw after the handover . they will only replace " military occupation " with " military presence " . 
at the summit of american states , bush managed with difficulty to save the plan for a free trade area 
( afp in monterrey on 13 th ) the us president bush has been trying to carry out his ambitious plan for a free trade area in americas . today at the summit of american states he won the support of 33 state leaders . 
but the countries which attend the summit hold different ideas about poverty in the western hemisphere which is growing more and more serious . the us has failed to include his anti @-@ corruption clause into the final communique . 
the free trade area of the americas starts from alaska in the north to argentina in the south . it is claimed to be the largest free area in the world with a population of 800 million and a total output value of 1,300 billion usd . 
however , the argentine president kirchner attacked the us plan at the closing ceremony of the 2 @-@ day summit . in his speech he said that the problems in americas cannot be solved by merely establishing a free trade area . 
in the early days when the " pre @-@ emptive " theory was proposed , some american political celebrities asked this question : what if other countries follow the example ? " 
as expected , more and more countries clamor to overwhelm others by " pre @-@ emptive " means . the " pre @-@ emptive " troops keep growing . 
this is a new trend worth our attention and study . 
in the very month when bush put forward his " pre @-@ emptive " strategy , the prime minister of australia howard was the first to voice his support . 
he said that once we have reliable information about terrorist attack against australia , australia will adopt the " pre @-@ emptive " strategy and will take military actions in the neighboring countries at all costs . 
he even suggest that the " pre @-@ emptive " principle be included into the un charter . he thinks it is necessary to make amendments to the un charter and give the right of " pre @-@ emptive " attack to all countries so as to crack down on terrorists and those countries that support terrorist activities . 
after the iraqi war , japan 's cry for " pre @-@ emptive " strategy has caused a clamor . 
the pakistani president musharraf won the vote of confidence in senate and lower house 
the information minister rasheed told the correspondents of afp : " musharraf had won the majority votes of the parliament . 
no parliament members voted against him . " 
in the 342 @-@ seat lower house , 191 members voted for musharraf ; the islamic creed members abstained ; the opposition parties boycotted this vote of confidence which was under dispute . 
musharraff made a concession to the federation of 6 islamic parties . he agreed to resign the post of the army commander @-@ in @-@ chief and at the same time dissolve the parliament . he would try his best to get approval from the supreme court within one month . 
in the 100 @-@ seat upper house , 56 members voted to support musharraf and 42 islamic and opposition members either abstained or boycotted . 
musharraf came to power in a coup in october , 1999 and has refused to step down ever since . 
the number of private enterprises in guangzhou exceeds for the first time that of the state @-@ owned and the state @-@ holding enterprises 
according to statistics , by the end of 2003 there were altogether 690,000 enterprises of different types ( including domestic @-@ funded , private and foreign @-@ funded ) , a 0.59 % growth over the previous year . 
the actual number of the private enterprises exceeds for the first time that of the state @-@ owned and state @-@ holding enterprises . 
according to statistics , the newly @-@ registered enterprises in the whole province total 105,000 with " one type down and two types up " . 
of which , 17,000 are domestic funded enterprises which have declined by 17.6 % over the previous year ; 81,600 are private enterprises which have grown by 29 % over the previous year ; 6,561 are foreign @-@ funded enterprises which have increased by 0.08 % over the previous year . 
the proportions between domestic @-@ funded , private and foreign @-@ funded enterprises are 16 :@ 78 @:@ 6 . 
shrinking workforce to knock economic output in eu , japan 
by contrast the plenty of labor in such developing countries such as india and china should help to promote economic growth . 
sammans , a managing director at the wef , said " economic output is determined by labour force growth and productivity rates , " 
in countries where labor force is in serious short supply , commodities and labor supply probably cannot meet the needs and living standards . " 
the statement also warns " that the proportion of japan will shrink from 8 % to 4 % . " 
advisors and distinguished guests attending the meeting include senior executives of transnational corporations , economic experts of international stature and scholars of great attainments . 
i am deeply impressed by the sincere cooperative spirit and practical attitude of the advisors . 
to bring into full play our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom not only benefits the planning and promotion of guangdong development but also is conducive to enhancing the cooperation and development between us in various fields . 
i have been looking forward to the convening of 2003 guandong international advisory conference on economy and development so that i could hear and get to know your real and penetrating views about the economic and social development of guangdong province . 
we gather here today with but one aim , i.e. to strengthen our cooperation and exchange , to expand room for development , to add vigor to the economic and social development in guangdong , and also to create opportunities for the advancement of your careers . 
china 's entry into wto marks an entirely new phase of opening up to the outside world . we are participating in the international competition on a larger scope , in wider fields and on a higher level . 
guangdong , a province on the mainland with the highest level of opening to the outside in economy , has led china in experiencing the unprecedented developing opportunities and severe challenges . 
guangdong people are concentrating their efforts in building an all @-@ round well @-@ off society and speeding up their pace of modernization . this will provide more opportunities and more room of development for all our friends . 
the guangdong economy , with great vigor and bright prospects , is marching to a new high with a dynamic stance . 
an aids suffering child is barred from school and the angry priest principal lodged a lawsuit against officials 
although the number of hiv victims is estimated to be 2.5 million in the country , aids and hiv are still taboo subjects in kenya . 
d'agostino is seeking a court order to force the school accept children without inquiring whether or not they are infected with hiv . 
the kenya ministry of education said through its lawyer gacirih that it does not know about the discrimination but understands the practice of the school . 
gacirih said that the education ministry is ready to solve the problem through negotiation with nyumbani home for children located on the northwest outskirts of nairobi . 
koome orders the two sides to talk it over and report the result of the talk tomorrow . 
( international ) the world trade organization ( wto ) submitted the dispute over " byrd subsidy " to arbitration 
this complaint for sanction originates from the fact that us has failed to cancel " byrd amendment " before the deadline set by wto . 
this practice of us was opposed by its major trade partners like eu , japan , etc. 
the wto made its final decision in january 2003 that this amendment violates the world trade rules and demanded the us to cancel it before december 27 th . 
but us has not implemented the decision of the wto . 
but later us questions the extent of sanction and the legality of the complaint . 
the second round of 6 @-@ party talks on the korean peninsula issue has come to a conclusion as people generally expected . 
during the talks the parties concerned have had contacts and explorations on the exterior issues around the peninsula nuclear crisis and have reached a consensus on holding the 3 rd round of talks before the end of june and on setting up a working group . 
the two leading roles ©¤ north korea and us have demonstrated no concessions and their bottom lines remain unyielding . 
however , the fascinating thing is that us showed during the talks an attitude of not being eager to settle the problem . it gives people the impression of " procrastination " . 
the tactics demonstrated by us is closely associated with the present developments of the international situation and the interest it is seeking in the new developments . 
gdp is an important macro economic index universally used in the world . 
it is extremely important for our country to maintain a gdp growth in the whole process of our modernization drive . 
only because the gdp growth by each percent will bring about job opportunities for 800,000 people in our country , we do have every reason to maintain the fast economic growth rate . 
the grand goal of building an all @-@ round well @-@ off society and the strategic aim for the 3 rd stage of our modernization depend on the sustained fast gdp growth to a great extent . 
however , we should see the deficiencies of gdp . 
for instance , it cannot easily reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth accurately , nor the social welfare level actually enjoyed by people , nor can it accurately measure social distribution and social justice , etc. 
on the other hand , gdp is not unique . 
therefore , we should approach the gdp accounting system with a scientific spirit , a scientific attitude and scientific ideological methods and give a right place to gdp in the economic and social development . 
while we must maintain a considerable growth rate , we must not attach too much importance to it , let alone being one @-@ sided or deliberately going after it . 
( international ) the airbus company surpassed the boeing company last year for the first time in delivery quantity 
the delivery of airbus company last year was a little more than 2002 year 's 303 planes . 
the airbus company predicts the market is still sluggish this year . so its delivery amount will be " approaching 300 " . 
the american boeing company announced earlier this month that its delivery of last year was 281 and its prediction for this year 's delivery is between 275 and 290 . 
in 2003 the proportion of airbus company delivery in that of the whole world rose to 52 % and its proportion in 2001 and 2002 were respectively 38 % and 44 % . 
last year the airbus company received 284 orders involving a total 32.8 billion usd . with 30 orders cancelled halfway , the actual order number was 254 , accounting for 52 % of the global total . 
in any country public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts are symbols of justice and fairness and are the most important system in safeguarding social stability . 
but unfortunately public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts are symbols of corruption in china . 
according to a report released recently by the national audit office which last year has carried out auditing of the financial expenditures of public security departments in 26 provinces and cities , the irregular amount of money had come up to 16.5 billion rmb . 
the trust crisis in public security departments , procuratorial organs and courts has been known to all . 
the liu yong event , sun zhigang event and the recent " bmw " incident in heilongjiang reflect this profound distrust . 
the " bmw " incident is an example in point . 
people give much more attention and concern to this issue than to the sars in the period of its spreading . 
in fact what people 's attention focus on is no longer the " bmw " incident itself , but expresses the distrust on the whole law @-@ enforcing system . 
departments concerned are very clear about this , so before long they took suffocating measures against mass media . 
nevertheless , problems remain there . 
( international ) the 2 crashed plane 's black boxes are both found in red sea 
both black boxes were found over 1,000 meters under water with about 30 meters between them . 
the responsible person of the egyptian accident investigation committee shaker qilada said that the first black box keeps records of various technical data before the accident and will be " decoded and analyzed " by the laboratory under the egyptian civil aviation ministry . 
although it appeared to be seriously damaged , qilada claimed it was " in good condition " . 
the two so @-@ called black box of the planes are actually light yellow in appearance . 
according to design , they can keep sending signals for 30 days 6,000 meters deep in sea so that the member of salvage team can locate and salvage them . 
the 2 planes which crashed in the red sea waters belong to the private airline , flash airlines in egypt . 
this 737 boeing passenger plane dropped into red sea soon after it took off from the famous egyptian tourist destination sharm el @-@ sheik on 3 rd this month , killing 148 people including 134 french , 1 moroccan and 13 egyptian aircrew . 
egyptian and french experts believe that the accident resulted from technical fault and not from terrorist attack or explosion . the 2 black boxes , if found , will help solve the mystery . 
the democratic party criticizes bush for creating the new axis of evil 
( afp in washington on 21 st ) the american democratic party not in office accuses bush for leading us into isolation in the world and criticizes him for creating the new " axis of evil " . 
the democratic leader at the house of representatives pelosi attacked , when the democratic party was rebroadcasting the president 's state of the union policy speech , the president for the casualties and expenses resulting from sending troops to iraq . 
because it is the year of american presidential election looms ( to be held on november 2 this year ) , the democratic party has prepared heavy bombs for bush . 
clark , one of the persons struggling for democratic nomination , says that bush had worked out his own " axis of evil " . 
bush used the term of " axis of evil " in his state of the union policy speech 2 years ago to refer to those countries which pose as threat to the us . 
clark said : " that is an axis of an accounting policy that menaces our future , a diplomatic policy that threatens our security and a domestic policy that puts our families to death . " 
developing economy and eradicating poverty are the pre @-@ requisites of sustainable development . 
the sustainable development of economy is a material basis for environmental protection and all @-@ round social progress . 
there is no development without settling the problem of survival , let alone sustainable development . 
to promote economic development and eradicate poverty is a road of necessity for developing countries to keep a sustainable development . 
the development of developed countries cannot continue without settling the poverty problem in developing countries . 
to make rational use of natural resources and protect the environment is a natural requirement for realizing the sustainable development . 
development cannot continue if resources are wasted and environment is sacrificed . 
only by following the circular economic road which based on effectively using resources and protecting the environment can the sustainable development be materialized . 
it is the ultimate goal of sustainable development to realize the all @-@ round social progress and promote the level and quality of people 's livelihood . 
7 years after nixon visited china and the sino @-@ america shanghai communique was published , carter administration accepted china 's stand on taiwan and effected the diplomatic relations between china and us . 
this incident and the successful visit to us by deng xiaoping opened a new chapter in the annals of relations between china and us . 
when reagon was in power , fierce disputes occurred on taiwan issue . 
hard talks between the governments of the two countries resulted in the well @-@ known " august 17 " communique in 1982 , with an agreement reached on partial settlement of arms sale to taiwan . 
shanghai communique , the communique on establishing diplomatic relations between china and us and the " august 17 " communique jointly formed the political cornerstone for sino @-@ american relations . 
during the 10 years after the diplomatic relations were established , the sino @-@ american relations on the whole were stable with the exchange and cooperation in various fields , despite occasional strifes over the taiwan issue and other problems . 
in the 1980 s and early 1990 s , the most profound changes took place in the world situation since the second world war : drastic changes in east europe , the disintegration of the soviet union and the end of the cold war . 
us took the lead in imposing sanctions against china , announced to sell 150 f @-@ 16 fighter planes to taiwan , linked human rights issue to the most @-@ favored @-@ nation treatment and permitted lee teng @-@ hui to visit america . all this reduced sino @-@ american relations to a record low . 
as china 's economy developed fast , its international position kept rising . 
more and more americans came to understand that the improvement and development of sino @-@ american relations were beneficial to both countries . 
as expected the malaysian prime minister abdullah announced the day before yesterday to dissolve the parliament and the new election will be held soon . 
abdullah took over power from mahathir last november . 4 months have passed since then . 
in spite of this he has decided to dissolve the parliament and hold the election in advance . 
undoubtedly , abdullah 's abrupt decision to hold the election shows that he has had an overall judgement of the domestic political situation . 
the economic situation in malaysia is good now and there is nothing for the opposition party to publicize maliciously or to make use of . 
in the meanwhile he calls for better efficiency in civil service , which helps to promote people 's trust . 
( international ) there is no political implication in aiding iran according to the american rescue team 
catlin points out that american 's organization of this rescue team " has nothing to do with politics " . america has provided similar humanitarian aid to iran in the past . 
he said the rescue team consists of 84 members . it set up a search team and a field hospital in bam area . besides , several groups tour the city to evaluate the damage of houses . 
they have also brought plastic films , tents and other rescue materials . 
when asked how long the american rescue team will stay in bam , catlin said : " we will stay as long as the host ( iran government ) will . " 
catlin also said that the american rescue team is free in its activities in bam . it is not protected or followed by iran police . 
besides , he said the response of iran government to the earthquake and its capacity to deal with it are " first class and outstanding . " 
the united states agency for international development is subordinate to agency for international development and cooperation and it is administered by the us state department . 
us and iran have not resumed their normal relations since they broke off their diplomatic relations in 1980 . 
until today usa regards iran as " a country that supports terrorism " and one of the countries of " the axis of evil . " 
this time it is on the invitation of iranian ambassador to un that us sent its rescue team to iran . 
however , the past challenge was not confined to aiding public house property . private house property was also full of trial . 
financial storm broke out in 1997 and assets foam soon ruptured . as a result the price of real estate dropped by 70 % , dealing a serious blow to house owners . this also served as the main cause for the worsening deflation in the past 5 years . 
now economy is taking a turn for the better . we are resolved to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sustainable and sound development of the real estate market . 
a sound real estate market is really essential for the further recovery of hong kong economy . 
we are also devoted to the protection and improvement of our living habitat . 
our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development . we will adopt better city design , strengthen the protection of scenic spots and historical sites in hong kong and improve the living environment . 
we will pay even more attention to the issue of overall environment . 
the lesson of the sars outbreak in hong kong last year reminded us that we must exert ourselves to create a more spacious , cleaner and hygienically and healthy habitat . 
we will intensify our efforts to beautify our environment by planting more trees , building more parks and providing more entertaining and fitness facilities for our residents . 
education serves as the foundation stone of modern civilization . 
educational cause must be developed on a large scale if we wish to promote the qualities of our people and increase the overall national strength . 
the rural education has extensive influence . it has a bearing on the rural economy and the development of the whole society . 
great changes have taken place in both cities and rural areas since reform and opening @-@ up started . this is closely associated with education , especially rural education . 
the implementation of the household contract responsibility system in the countryside greatly emancipated the productive forces . 
the rise of the new technological revolution in the world and the drive to build a well @-@ off society in a comprehensive way set higher demands for the scientific and cultural qualities and the ideological morals of the rural population . 
an overall well @-@ off society is impossible without the popularization of the 9 @-@ year compulsory education in the countryside and without the overall promotion of qualities of peasants . 
we must be fully aware of the basic , leading and comprehensive role of the rural education in the building of an overall well @-@ to @-@ do society . 
to be a ruling party does not mean the holding of power but the increase of responsibilities . 
for a long time the democratic progressive party has played the role of " part of the government " in the effort to expand the diplomacy of taiwan and has made outstanding achievements in this regard . 
i will take over the chairman of " cald " in march of next year and wish to create more opportunities for taiwan to contribute more to the international community in the capacity of a world organization leader . 
besides , the democratic progressive party took an active part in the affairs of " liberal international " after it became its member last year . 
apart from sending its representative to the london head office of the federation , the democratic progressive party will cooperate with other member parties and hold forums in central and southern america and europe on political reform . 
shenzhen authorities exercise sars quarantine on drivers who enter or leave china 
the bureau also calls upon related organizations and the entry & exit drivers to cooperate with its work to prevent sars spreading into or out of china from shenzhen ports with an aim to preserve people 's health . 
the discussion involves the politics , humanity and security of iraq and the special envoy to be sent to iraq by un . the 3 parties had a frank exchange of views . 
the plan of britain and america to hand over power in iraq is facing resistance . it naturally arrests the attention of the world whether or not and how un will play its part in the cause of iraq reconstruction . 
since early may last year us declared the main military operations in iraq were over , the situation in the country has been keeping shaky and unstable . the anti @-@ occupation attacks popped up one after another , causing great casualties of the us @-@ british coalition troops and unpeaceful everyday . 
the former iraqi president saddam was caught on december 13 last year , but the us rapture did not last long and the security situation was not improved . the intensified activities of the resistance movement put the occupying authorities in a dilemma . 
on the other hand the iraqi public and the arab countries unanimously demand the withdrawal of foreign troops and returning of power to iraqi people so that the iraqi people can run their own country . 
in the meanwhile us and britain try hard to remold iraq according to their will and thence get out of this quagmire " in a dignified way " . 
therefore , the way and process of the handover has become the focus of present iraqi issues . 
but the shiahs who constitute the majority of the iraqi population stress that direct general election should be held to return power to the iraqi people in a really fair manner . 
us is to set free hundreds of iraqi prisoners 
pachachi praises the above measure taken by the coalition , saying that this is the result of the forceful canvassing of the governing council . 
pachachi told journalists : " governing council has long been committed to advocating the reconciliation spirit among the iraqi people . to achieve the goal , we demand the coalition forces to review the problem of prisoners . " 
a spokesman of the occupying coalition who is not willing to reveal his name said later that altogether 506 prisoners will be released in the next few weeks . 
bremer said in his brief speech : " the coalition will release the first hundred prisoners . " 
bremer displays a conciliatory stance at a time when the occupying coalition is trying to pacify the resentments of sunni islam society under hussein . 
hussein was captured by american troops following 8 months on the fugitive run . 
bremer said : " the tyrant hussein is imprisoned now and most of his underlings are either killed or captured . it is the right time for reconciliation . " 
the conditions for release are the prisoners " must give up violence " ; they have to find community personages , religious or clan leaders as guarantors ; the guarantors must be responsible for good and lawful behaviors of the prisoners . 
bremer points out that none of the prisoners to be set free are directly involved in violence against american troops or other deadly attacks , nor are they related to any anti @-@ human crimes . 
bremer said that those to be freed " have come to see their crimes " and " we are ready to provide some of them opportunities to repent and start anew . " 
the burundi president : the former rebellious army shall join the military leadership 
the former rebellious army the " forces for the defense of democracy " expresses its welcome , praising it as " an important step " towards the establishment of new armed forces . 
ndayizeye said : " the parties that have signed ( the november 2003 ceasefire ) agreement should complete their arrangement before january 5 for the station locations of troops . " 
he also stated that the joint chiefs of staff including rebellious army leaders should be set up no later than january 7 . 
this work is chiefly related to the " forces for the defense of democracy " , the largest of the 6 rebellious military organizations that signed the truce . 
the 7 th rebellious organization " fnl " refused to sign the peace accord . 
about 300,000 people have been killed in burundi since the civil war broke out between the hutu rebellious army and the tutsi government army in 1993 . 
recently , there has been a hot topic discussed by the european public : is the " 3 magnate " summit of german prime minister schroeder , the french president chirac and the british prime minister blair going to be increasingly systematic and regular ? 
public opinion calls the " big three " of germany , france and britain " a new troika " of eu . the relationship of the 3 nations is called a " new triangle " affair . 
a survey of the 100 year history of europe will tell you that a basic characteristic of the german @-@ france @-@ british triangle is that british and france jointly contain and resist germany . 
the two world wars are the evidence . 
during the cold war east and west germany were sandwiched between the warsaw pact and nato . 
but in recent years , with the restart of the " german @-@ france axis " and the fierce conflicts between the ideas of world monopolarization and world multipolarization , great dissensions occurred inside eu over the iraqi issue : 
" the old europe " represented by germany and france and " the new europe " represented by britain and poland are poles apart in their stands on the iraqi issue . 
this split occurred accidentally at a time when eu is going to carry out its largest expansion in history . 
asia has long and brilliant cultures . the drainage areas of the yellow river and the yangtze , the indus and the ganges valleys , and the reaches of the euphrates and the tigris are famous birthplaces of human civilizations . 
in the long process of historical development the asian peoples have written splendid chapters for the development of human civilization . 
in modern times asian has experienced hardships and sufferings . people of various country have made unremitting efforts for liberation and development and have gained tremendous achievements . 
but there is still a long way to go if asia wishes to have a new rise and to enjoy new prosperity . 
to strengthen cooperation , promote development and achieve win @-@ for @-@ all is a way asia must follow in order to rise and become prosperous . it is also where the fundamental interest of the asian people lies . 
in the new situation of the new century asian development faces new opportunities . 
peace and development are the themes of the contemporary world and the overall peaceful international environment provides favorable external conditions for asian development . 
asian , with rich resources and vast markets , is an area in the world with the greatest economic vitality and with tremendous potentials for development . 
nasa said there is now no news from the spirit mars probe 
( afp in washington on 22 nd ) an official from nasa said today that nasa has lost contact with spirit , a mars probe that has landed on mars , due to serious faults . 
mars exploration rover project manager theisinger said : " we have found serious abnormalities with the probe . "

spirit landed on mars on january 3 and began to look for signs of life that might have existed on this red star last week . 
the twin probing vehicle opportunity of spirit is expected to touch down at night from january 24 to 25 . 
this probing mission costs 820 million usd . it was planned that the 2 solar energy probes would operate for 3 months . 
( sports ) rusedski : i am a victim of atp 
( xinhua news agency in london on january 9 th ) the tennis player rusedski who admits that his drugs test is positive said on 9 th that many others have taken drugs and he is but a scapegoat of association of tennis professionals . 
rusedski is no. 2 man tennis player of britain . 
on 8 th he admitted having a drug test last july on an atp tour . the atp testers have already notified him that there is steroid nandrolone of low content in his urine sample .

the 30 @-@ year @-@ old rusedski said : " i happen to be picked out and this treatment is mistaken , unfair and discriminating . " 
they should not prosecute me . instead they should investigate to find the whole story . 
rusedski pledges to " contend to the end " for his unjust treatment . 
he denies any act of using drugs to enhance his performance . 
he says the origin of the issue is not himself , but the whole tennis world . 
an ancient arabic proverb goes : " one day 's turmoil is worse than a thousand years ' tyranny . " 
is this what the northeast asian countries are worried about presently ? 
i think the answer is probably affirmative . 
the attitudes of the countries in the region towards the strategy have been the focus of this investigation . 
besides , the investigation provides an analysis of the threat posed by the north korean nuclear program , based on the possible nuclear attack and its damage assumed by the neighbors of north korea and on their fears . 
china and russia hold that the danger of north korea using nuclear weapons is low or very low while japan and south korea believe that the threat is considerably great . 
all the northeast asian countries are in favor of engagement with north korea . 
japan is for blocking and other countries believe that blocking strategy is acceptable in some circumstance . 
i know the legislative council began to discuss with the government about the issue of long @-@ term office of the legislature as early as 10 years ago . 
in the meanwhile the government has been always considering a long @-@ term plan for the relocation of the government headquarters after the past 10 years . 
therefore i understand that the government decision to postponed the relocation project including the timar development project of the new office building of the legislative council will surely disappoint some of legislative council members . 
i know the legislative council members will have to suffer from many inconveniences and work in places of poor condition during this period . 
however , just as i told my government colleagues who are affected by the decision , i hope that everyone will put the interest of the public in the first place , get to know the situation and put up with it in this period . 
to put off the project of a new legislative building located at timar will help reduce the financial pressure on the government for the next couple of years , is in conformity with the public interest and is accepted by the public . 
the government will , as soon as the financial situation improves , start the new legislative building project located at timar . we will do this according to our present plan . 
as the biggest debtor country , us has additional amount to its debt . 
the us department of finance announced on january 16 that by the end of september last year the total amount of debt america owed foreign creditors had added up to 6,494,000 million usd , a 2.2 % growth over the figure published last time . 
on an average , every american has a foreign debt of 20,000 usd . 
statistics indicate that foreign private investors have controlled 40 % of the us government bonds . 
it reminds people of the first half of the 20 th century when keynes proposed the following stratagem to roosvelt : if economy is stimulated at home by deficit policy , the financial deficits can be solved by borrowing money from outside . 
this stratagem really played an important role in setting the matter of extreme urgency of economic crisis by stimulating " effective demands " . 
however , people have noticed that several us administrations have tended to use this as " a miraculous cure " . 
since president reagan advocated tax reduction and arms expansion in 1980 s , the american financial deficit has kept growing and finally us has become the biggest debtor nation .

this is the first time for the amount of livestock on hand to rise after 3 successive years of big decline . 
there was plenty of rain in summer last year and no heavy snow in spring and winter , which created favorable conditions for the improvement of mongolian animal husbandry .

compared with the same period last year , the amount of camels , goats and sheep is increased and that of horses and cattle somewhat reduced . 
the mongolian animal husbandry was on the whole privatized in 1990 s last century .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet 
ramallah , feb. 9 ( xinhua ) ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet 
( xinhua reporters : wang hao , huang min ) 
following the victory of palestine 's islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) in parliamentary elections , how the new government will be laid out has become a focus of international attention . 
what kind of policies hamas carries out will directly influence the policy directions taken by the various parties involved in the peace process . 
at the same time , the resistant attitude of the us and israel will be an additional variable in the prospects of the hamas @-@ lead government . 
at present , the different palestinian sides are stepping up discussions in an active quest for a breakthrough in problems and sensitive issues that the cabinet formation poses toward future development of the situation . 
( subhead ) who will become prime minister ? 
since hamas won the right to form a cabinet , some outsiders have expressed worry that a split could take place between the " hamas prime minister " and the palestinian leader , abbas . 
in addition , the leader of hamas , mashaal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that a palestinian government formed by the leaders of hamas would not recognize israel , a hard @-@ line signal that heightened international concern . 
the us and israel have clearly stated they will not accept a hamas @-@ led government with real power and have threatened to cut off economic aid to palestine and freeze the transfer of tax revenues . 
but this has not prevented hamas from carrying out some agile strategic adjustments , including a compromise policy of selecting independents . 
according to reports , in order to maximize recognition from the international community , in recent days overseas and domestic leaders of hamas gathered in egypt decided to select an independent figure , ismail haniyeh , chairman of the board of gaza islamic university , to become the new prime minister . 
concerned parties have not yet responded to the move . 
palestinian analyst hisham said that , whoever takes over the prime @-@ ministership , the most important thing is that the person should be capable of toning down hamas ' hard @-@ line character , since only in this way can the success of the cabinet be guaranteed . 
( subhead ) how will authority be distributed ? 
from an internal perspective , the biggest challenge faced by the hamas @-@ led cabinet is a lack of adequate experience in power . 
after the election , hamas raise the possibility of a " political partnership " with fatah and the joint establishment of a national coalition government , but until now fatah has not given a positive response . 
fatah is internally split regarding whether to participate in the cabinet . one faction advocates taking part in the new government in order to have some sway ; another faction refuses the invitation by hamas and wants instead to be " an active opposition " in parliament . 
informed sources say fatah , with persuasion coming from abbas , is gradually leaning toward participating in the new government . 
even so , hamas and fatah will still haggle over the distribution of cabinet posts . 
another path would be to establish a cabinet outside the parliamentary framework and ignore party affiliation . 
according to reports , hamas has also laid out a government composed uniquely of experts , but the actual name list is still unknown . 
in view of us and israeli attitudes , a government of technical experts is a way of forming a cabinet that will help lighten pressure from outside . 
palestine 's basic law provides that the naming of the prime minister and the cabinet will take three to five weeks to complete once the new parliament takes over on the 16 th of this month . 
( subhead ) how do the weapons fit in ? 
hamas ' weapons constitute another thorny issue in the forming of the new government . 
the us and israel have an extremely hard @-@ line attitude , insisting that hamas renounce violence and refusing to let it take part in the government while armed . 
the leader of hamas , mashaal , emphasized on the 9 th that armed resistance is the organization 's " strategic choice " . 
the issue of weapons in reality includes two levels : the legality of weapons and the administration of jurisdiction over armed forces . 
hamas has floated in the past the idea of unifying all the armed factions into a palestinian national force , or " people 's army " , but the idea was not widely acknowledged and was even criticize by the palestine islamic jihad . 
palestine currently has 60,000 security personnel , the vast majority of which are from the fatah camp . 
in addition , fatah also has some loose organizational ties to affiliated armed factions such as the al @-@ aqsa martyrs brigade and the fatah hawks . 
responsible for forming a cabinet , hamas will have to come to terms with fatah regarding how to manage these various self @-@ governing armed groups and reasonably distribute power over the security administration . 
according to local media reports , abbas wants to oversee the security and intelligence forces . the police and civil defense forces would be overseen by the internal affairs department of the new government . 
but the various sides are still negotiating this sensitive issue and until now there have been no developments . 
portion of beijing @-@ harbin highway closed after accident leads to waste @-@ oil leak . 
according to reports , the tanker @-@ truck was hauling waste oil left over from the production of coke .

a portion of the road to harbin has be closed in both directions and many cars are making detours . 
at present , the competent department is cleaning the site . the cause of the accident is being investigated . 
( overseas china @-@ related ) sino @-@ myanmar trade ties show strong development and vast potential 
counselor tang hai said the senior leadership of the two countries regularly exchange visits and vigorously promote the development of cooperative trade relations between the two countries . 
during a high @-@ level exchange of visits in 2004 , the two sides signed 33 trade cooperation agreements , most of which are now being implemented . 
he said it was us $ 1.14 bn in 2004 and in 2005 reached us $ 1.209 bn , consisting of us $ 935 m in exports from chinese and us $ 274 m in imports . 
among bilateral trade last year , trade ( including border trade ) between china 's yunnan province and myanmar totaled us $ 630 m , up 14.6 % from the previous year . 
chinese companies developing engineering projects in myanmar help stimulate china 's export of complete sets of machinery and electronic products and myanmar has become an important export market for china 's complete sets of equipment , machinery and electronic products . 
according to statistics from chinese customs , electronic and machinery product exports in the last five or six years have accounted for about 45 % of china 's total exports to myanmar . 
counselor tang hai said myanmar is rich in natural resources and chinese companies have started investing in projects to exploit myanmar 's resources , including oil and natural gas , nickel and copper . cooperative trade relations between china and myanmar have a large potential for development . 
he hopes chinese enterprises will have a long @-@ term outlook . they need to learn to avoid risk and practice cautious decision @-@ making . they must foster a good company image and when accepting a project they must guarantee quality and completion as scheduled in order to win glory for our country . 
the two sides are expected to sign a number of trade cooperation agreements during the visit . 
hdtv gradually becoming mainstream in us 
the recent super bowl , an american @-@ style football competition , became for us advertisers a warm @-@ up match to welcome in the age of high definition television ( hdtv ) . 
according to a recent report in the financial times , the us congress recently passed a bill that requires us broadcasters to halt all transmission of the current analog television signals on february 17 , 2009 and only transmit digital signals . 
this implies that there is a definite time @-@ table for the full digitalization of television program broadcasting in the us . 
the spread of hdtv relies on the one hand on consumers buying the television sets and on the other hand on producers providing high definition digital programming . 
although digital television has been discussed repeatedly over the past few years , it has not become reality . 
on this issue , there was a turning point this year . 
according to forecasts by america 's consumer electronics association , this year the number of digital televisions sold will exceed the number of conventional televisions sold for the first time . furthermore , 85 % of the digital televisions sold will be hd products . 
japanese researchers develop new model of highly effective artificial kidney

" we express our sincerest sympathies and condolences to the families of those killed . " 
vusi b. koloane said , " we feel sorry for what has happened and ask the chinese people to believe that the government of south africa is thoroughly investigating every case involving chinese . "

according to official chinese statistics , south africa continued to remain china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 . 
bilateral trade grew 23 % year @-@ on @-@ year to us $ 7.27 bn . 
however , tourism industry sources said the serial killings of chinese citizens in south africa in 2004 had a marked influence on the number of tourists traveling to south africa . 
statistics from the south african tourism board show that 20,331 chinese tourists visited south africa in the first half of 2005 , representing a year @-@ on @-@ year decrease of 14.9 % . 
approximately 200,000 chinese currently live in south africa . they are spread throughout south africa 's cities , town and villages . 
analysts here have attributed the consistently high rate of crime to the large wealth gap in south african society , high unemployment , the rampant use of guns and the lack of a death penalty to serve as a deterrent . 
because many chinese do not understand english , they keep cash on their person and in their homes , making is easier to become the target of an attack by criminals seeking money .
