( international ) u.s. service industries grow at a slower pace than manufacturing 
according to ism standard , a service industry index over 50 indicates an expansion while a figure below 50 indicates a contraction in the industry . 
according to another report published by ism on the 2 nd , u.s. manufacturing index surged in december to a 20 @-@ year high . 
this shows u.s. service industries are growing at a slower pace than manufacturing . 
growth in manufacturing helps create more jobs and also promotes economic growth . however , a growth in service industries usually has a more significant effect in the reduction of unemployment and the stimulation of economic growth . 
saarc concluded : a glimmer to better indo @-@ pakistan relation 
in her speech at the concluding session of 12 th summit of south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) , bangladeshi prime minister zia described " the summit as an important watershed in enhancing south asian regional cooperation " . 
yesterday , indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf met outside the summit for the first time since a near war conflict in 2002 . 
the hostility between the two super powers in saarc had already hampered regional cooperation and development . the leaders of participating nations were all encouraged with the peace momentum generated by the historic meeting between india and pakistan . 
" i think the standpoints of india and pakistan have clearly changed and they are striding forward to a peace process , " pakistani military analyst masood told afp . 
as pakistani president musharraf declared the official closing of the summit , he praised the consents on antiterrorism , poverty suppression and the construction of a free trade zone from 2006 . 
he further praised the summit for " injecting new vitality into regional cooperation " . 
( international ) china and albania signed economic and technical collaboration agreement 
according to the agreement , china will provide albania with a grant of rmb 15 million , which will be used in economic collaboration projects agreed between the two governments or otherwise be provided in form of goods and materials from china . 
after the signing ceremony , hajdaraga expressed gratitude for the grant from the chinese government and he also wished the people of china a happy chinese new year . 
he said the agreement clearly illustrated the friendship between the two countries and the close cooperation in many areas . 
from now on , the two countries will further strengthen the friendly cooperation , which is built on top the foundation of mutual trust . 
the chinese ambassador tien cang cun said the financial grant conveys the friendly feelings of chinese government and the people of china towards albanian government and the people of albania . at the same time , it also reflects the traditional friendship and cooperation between the two countries . 
since a delegation of security council visited six nations in western africa last june , the development in the overall situation of the region have been encouraging , despite some complications in specific countries . 
it is even more gratifying to note that liberia is gradually breaking away from the impact of chaos caused by a prolonged war following the deployment of the united nations mission in liberia . the country starts to head for revival and reconstruction . 
the political affairs in the republic of guinea bissau have also achieved positive progress and the transitional government undertook to hold election for legislators in march this year . 
we look forward to an early decision by the security council . 
the secretariat , the economic community of west african states and the related parties are also striving to solve , on a regional basis , cross @-@ border problems of small arms , mercenaries and use of children as soldiers etc. and have achieved positive fruitful results . 
( international ) arab league secretary @-@ general urged u.s. not to impose " democracy " on middle east 
xinhua news agency , geneva , january 21 - moussa , secretary @-@ general , league of arab states ( arab league ) urged on the 21 st that u.s. should never attempted to impose democracy to middle east but rather discuss democracy with arab countries . 
" if they ( the americans ) want democracy in middle east , they better live up with their promise and implement democracy in iraq first , " moussa told reporters in the world economic forum , currently in session at davos , switzerland . 
he said the arab league is america 's best partner to discuss democratic reform in the middle east area . 
" as long as you propose your idea and are willing to listen to our viewpoint , then we can talk about anything . 
we do not oppose democracy . however , democracy is not a process or an order that can be executed immediately . " 
moussa pointed out that u.s. government has yet to convince people that they can bring " democracy " to iraq by invading the country . 
" they said they went to iraq to show us a sample of democracy . 
however , we have seen nothing up till now . " 
despite official result of the presidential election in georgia on the 4 th has yet to be revealed , it looks the victory of saakashvili , a candidate jointly supported by right wing parties and the leader of national movement , is the inevitable outcome . 
the central election commission of georgia said on the 7 th that , in the 89 % of votes already counted , over 95 % of the voters supported saakashvili . 
some heads of the commonwealth of independent states have already sent congratulatory telegrams to this young politician . 
actually , saakashvili has already proclaimed victory himself as early as the night that the voting ended . 
he claimed the result of the polls is a " victory of the people " and said georgia will take some rapid actions to create its own future . 
in interviews by media , many voters said they cast their votes to saakashvili for the purposes of choosing a " new hope " . 
even the former president shevardnadze , who was forced to resign , expressed support to this political rival of the old days and praised saakashvili as " young , energetic and well educated " . 
at the same time of putting hopes on saakashvili , people also noticed that there were no major changes in georgia 's situation after shevardnadze 's resignation two months ago . 
we can say that the newly elected president is still facing the same old problems . 
lots of people , but not developed . these are the two crucial national conditions of china . 
this is what a chinese leader must keep firmly in mind at all times . 
to solve the 1.3 -@ billion @-@ population problem , we cannot depend on others but only on ourselves . 
since the founding of the people 's republic of china , we have attained significant achievements in our development , but we also took some winding courses and lost some valuable opportunities . 
since the reform and opening in 1978 , we have finally found a correct path for our own development . 
and this is : the people of china have to build their own socialism with chinese characteristics independently . 
the essence of this path is to mobilize all positive factors , liberate and develop production capability , respect and protect the chinese people 's freedom to pursue happiness and well @-@ being . 
china 's reform and opening have covered rural villages to cities , from economic issues to political , cultural and social areas . 
according to statistics , young people who selected to commit suicide are mostly in the age of 15 to 19 , and quite a number of them were actually only 10 - 14 years old . 
the stress on studies and deviation from expectation are naturally also an area of communication between children and parents . 
the stress of moving up to college has been a burden for a long @-@ time to local students during their growth and development period . sometimes , stress is self @-@ imposed but often parents impose the stress to children . 
parents demand their children to have good academic results . they frequently compare their children with other children and demand their children to work harder . this will obviously create great stress to children . however , it is really the channel of communication and guidance behind the stress that is the real thermometer for measuring parent and children relation . 
it is understood that the spiritual distress of many young students requiring counsel was caused by unrealistic expectation of their parents , which pushes students into dead corners . 
due to singapore 's success and rapid development , parents feel their children have much better material conditions than themselves . they naturally believe their children should have better performance than themselves . 
parents usually forget their own performance in various areas is not that outstanding when they were kids themselves . 
iraq 's governing council has signed an agreement with u.s. occupying forces a few days ago . they announced a phased timetable for the power transfer to the people of iraq by june next year . 
the people of iraq are indifferent to the agreement ; u.s. public opinions even consider the agreement " a major gamble " . 
anyhow , most people are between believing and suspicion . most of them are adopting a wait and see attitude . 
it is not without reason that international community has so many doubts about it . 
people can see that u.s. is not really willing to return sovereignty to people of iraq . therefore , the transfer of political power may not be thorough and it is likely to have a lot of hidden issues . 
first , the transitional government scheduled to be formed in may next year is not derived from direct election . instead , it is elected by the " transitional national assembly " , which , in turn , is elected by 18 election committees at provincial level . 
inevitably , people may think u.s. controls the process and its legitimacy might be challenged . 
second , u.s. announced that u.s. troops would not withdraw even after the power transfer . effectively , they are just changing from " occupying forces " to " existing forces " only . 
summit of the americas : bush barely keeps the free trade zone plans 
( agence france @-@ presse , monterrey , mexico , 13 th ) - u.s. president bush won a grudging support from 33 other leaders in the summit of americas today for the plans to launch an ambitious pan @-@ american free trade zone next year . 
however , the summit of the americas remained divided on how to combat spreading poverty in the western hemisphere and the united states failed to get an anti @-@ corruption clause included in the final announcement . 
the free trade zone , which would stretch from alaska in the north to argentina in the south , is entitled the world 's largest free trade area , with a market of some 800 million people and a gross domestic product of 13 @-@ trillion u.s. dollars . 
however , argentine president kirchner criticized the u.s. in his speech at the closing of the two @-@ day summit . he said a free trade area could not possibly solve the problems of the americas . 
when the theory of " preemptive strike " first came out , some important political figures in u.s. had already raised this question , " what should we do if other countries gradually follow our way ? " 
unfortunately just as predicted , more and more countries are saying they would " strike first " in the past two years and the " preemptive strike " team gets bigger and bigger . 
this is obviously a new trend worthwhile attention and study . 
in the same month as bush brought out the " strike first " strategy , australian prime minister howard was the first one to stand out and expressed support . 
he said once australia has obtained reliable information about terrorist attack on the country , it will adopt the " strike first " strategy and is not hesitate to initiate military actions against nearby countries . 
he even proposes to amend the charter of union nations such that the " strike first " principle can be written in the charter giving nations the right to " strike first " . he thinks this is necessary for the suppression of terrorists or the suppression of countries that support terrorist activities . 
since the iraq war , it is widely reported that japan is stepping up its call for " strike first " strategy . 
pakistani president musharraf won the trust vote in senate and lower house 
information minister rashid told afp reporter , " musharraf has won a majority vote in the national assembly . 
there was not a single vote against him . " 
in the 342 @-@ seat lower house , 191 legislators voted in favor of musharraf . legislators of islamist parties had abstained from voting while opposition parties boycotted the controversial vote of confidence . 
musharraf made concessions to the six islamist parties and agreed to resign as army chief . at the same time , musharraf has to obtain supreme court approval within 1 month if he ever sacks the parliament . 
in the 100 @-@ seat senate , 56 senators voted to support musharraf . the 42 senators of islamist and opposition parties had either abstained or boycotted the vote . 
musharraf obtained power in a coup in october 1999 and has refused to step down since then . 
in china : number of active privately @-@ owned enterprises in guangdong has exceeded the combined number of state @-@ owned enterprises and their holding enterprises

the ratio of new domestic , privately @-@ owned and foreign invested enterprises to total new registrations was 16 :@ 78 @:@ 6 . 
shrinking workforce will impact economic output in european union and japan 
in contrast , the abundance of workers in developing countries such as india and china should help boost economic growth . 
managing director of www , sammans , said , " economic output is determined by the growth in labor force and the productivity rates . 
in countries with dramatic labor shortages , the supply of goods and services may not meet demands and standards of living . " 
" japan 's share would decline from eight percent to four percent , " the statement also warned . 
consultants and guests participating in this conference include senior leaders of multinationals , world @-@ renowned economists , experts and scholars with profound attainments . 
i can deeply feel the sincere spirit in cooperation and the enthusiastic stand to deal with concrete matters offered by every consultant here . 
as we bring our cooperative spirit and collective wisdom into full play , we are not only benefiting the planning and promotion of guangdong developments but also benefiting our mutual efforts to advance our cooperation and development .

guangdong is the province within the mainland economy that is most opened to foreigners . it has taken the lead and experienced an unprecedented development opportunities as well as rigorous challenges . 
the people of guangdong are concentrating their attention to build a full @-@ scale fairly prosperous society . guangdong is accelerating its modernization and this will bring more development opportunities and rooms for every friend .

schools refuse to admit hiv kids : priest took issue to court 
notwithstanding an estimated 2.5 million people are carrying the hiv virus in kenya , aids and hiv are still considered taboo topics in kenya . 
d'agostino is seeking a court order forcing state @-@ owned schools to enroll children irrespective of their hiv status . 
kenyan ministry of education , through its lawyer gacivih , said it was unaware of the discrimination but such school policy appeared sympathetic . 
gacivih said the ministry of education was willing to discuss the matter with nyumbani children 's home , which is situated in the northwestern outskirts of nairobi . 
judge koome ordered the two sides to hold discussions today and report the conclusion back to court tomorrow . 
( international ) wto sends dispute on " byrd subsidy " to arbitration 
the demand for sanctions was filed because united states failed to eradicate the " byrd amendment " within the time limit stipulated by wto . 
european union , japan , and other major u.s. trade partners opposed the u.s. method . 
wto finally decided in january 2003 that the amendment violated global trade regulations and demanded u.s. to abolish it before december 27 of that year . 
however , u.s. did not comply with the wto ruling . 
however , u.s. challenged the legality of the complaint and the level of sanction shortly afterwards . 
the second round six @-@ party talks on korean peninsula nuclear issue has ended in a way as many have expected . 
in this meeting , the related parties have made contacts and probes on surrounding issues to the korean peninsula nuclear crisis . they have also reached the common consensus to set up a working group before the third round of talks , which is to be held before the end of june this year . 
the two important figures -- north korea and united states have not made any concession and the fundamental position of the both sides have not changed a bit . 
nevertheless , the conspicuous point is that u.s. does not show any desire for a fast resolution of the problem in this meeting but rather gives people the impression of " dragging " on . 
this kind of u.s. policy is obviously related to the latest development in international situations and the benefits that u.s. attempts to gain from these latest developments . 
gdp is generally accepted as an important macro economic indicator in our world . 
it is of crucial importance that we maintain a growth in gdp throughout the modernization and development process in our nation . 
judging simply from the fact that one percent growth in our gdp these days could create corresponding employment for eight hundred thousand people , we have to maintain a fast growth trend in our economy . 
to a very great extent , the magnificent objective of building a full @-@ scale fairly prosperous society and the realization of the third strategic framework of modernization rely on a sustained high growth in gdp . 
nevertheless , we can visualize the gdp indicator also has many defects . 
for example , it does not precisely reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth . it does not reflect the level of social benefits actually enjoyed by people . it also does not measure resources allocation or social justice in our society , etc. etc. 
in addition , gdp is also not the only indicator . 
therefore , we have to use scientific spirit , scientific attitude and scientific thought to deal with the existing computation system for gdp and properly position the gdp indicator within the overall development of our society . 
we need to maintain a certain growth rate but not putting too much emphasis on that . we cannot adopt a one @-@ sided view and pursue it painstakingly . 
( international ) airbus company delivered more planes than boeing last year 
airbus company 's delivery last year was slightly higher than the 303 planes in 2002 . 
the company expects the market to be slow this year and hence , delivery is likely to be " closed to 300 planes " . 
u.s. boeing company said earlier this month that they delivered 281 planes last year and forecasted a delivery of 275 to 290 planes this year . 
in 2003 , airbus company 's delivery increased to 52 % of the global market . its market share for 2001 and 2002 were 38 % and 44 % respectively . 
last year , airbus company received 284 orders from customers with a total value of us $ 32.8 billion . excluding 30 orders that were cancelled in between , the actual number of orders was 254 and accounted for 52 % of the global market . 
public security , procuratorate and judiciary should be images of fair and justice in any country and is also the most important system to protect social stability . 
unfortunately , public security , procuratorate and judiciary have become images of corruption in china . 
according to the report by china 's national audit office , the result of an examination on financial expenditures in public security institutions in 26 province / city showed that spending against regulation amounted to rmb 16.5 billion across the nation . 
the result makes it open that the distrust in public security , procuratorate and judiciary has reached a crisis state . 
the liu yong case , the sun zhigang case and the latest " bmw " case in heilong jiang have all reflected the profound distrust . 
the " bmw " incident is a typical case . 
the close attention to the case has far exceeded the attention to " sars " during the " sars " crisis period because people are so much concerned about the issue . 
in fact , people are not caring about the " bmw " incident itself . people are expressing their distrust to the whole judiciary system . 
the related departments understand this clearly and they have taken measures to shut up the media soon afterwards . 
however , the problem is still there . 
( international ) in red sea : the two black boxes of the crashed plane have been found 
the two black boxes were found at a depth of 1,000 meters and they were about 30 meters apart . 
shaker qilada , head of the egyptian investigation team , said the first black box had recorded all kinds of technical data prior to the crash . the box will be handed to a laboratory of egyptian civil aviation for " decoding and analysis " . 
even though the black box appeared to be seriously damaged , qilada said it was in " good condition " . 
the two so @-@ called black boxes on the plane are actually yellow in color . 
in order to help search teams to locate and recover black boxes , they are designed to send a signal on a continuous basis for 30 days from a depth up to 6,000 meters below sea . 
the plane crashed in red sea belongs to a private egyptian airline company , the flash airlines . 
the boeing 737 crashed into the red sea on the 3 rd of this month shortly after take @-@ off from the egyptian resort town of sharm el @-@ sheikh . all 148 aboard , including 134 french , one moroccan and 13 egyptian crewmembers , were killed . 
egyptian and french experts believed the accident was caused by a mechanical failure rather than a terror attack or explosion . as the black boxes were found , they will help reveal this puzzle . 
democrats criticized bush for creating a new axis of evil 
( agence france @-@ presse , washington , 21 st ) - on the evening of 20 th , opposition democrats accused president bush of leading the united states into an isolation from the world and creating a new " axis of evil " with his policies . 
after a replay of the president 's state of the union speech , the democratic leader in the house of representatives , pelosi , attacked the human and financial costs of last year 's iraq invasion . 
the opposition democrats is being especially hard hitting against bush because it is another election year ( u.s. presidential election will be held in november this year ) . 
clark , a leading contender for the democratic nomination , said bush had created his own " axis of evil " . 
two years ago , bush created the term " axis of evil " in his state of the union speech to describe some countries that were threatening united states . 
" that is an axis of fiscal policies that threaten our future ; foreign policies that threaten our security and domestic policies that put families dead , " clark said . 
economic development and elimination of poverty are the fundamental premises to realize sustainable development . 
sustainable economic development is the material foundation for environmental protection and overall progress in our society . 
if the question of survival is not solved , development becomes irrelevant and no one can talk about sustainable development . 
endeavor to economic advancement and elimination of poverty is developing countries ' only route to sustainable development . 
if the poverty problem in developing countries is not solved , it will also be difficult for developed countries to continue their development . 
sensible usage of resources and protection of environment are inevitable requirements for realization of sustainable development . 
development based on wastage of resources and contamination to environment cannot possibly continue for long . 
the only route to sustainable development is a recycle economy , which is based on the foundation of environmental protection and makes the most efficient use of resources . 
the ultimate goal of sustainable development is to improve our society across the broad and enhance both the standard and quality of people 's living . 
seven years after nixon visited china and the sino @-@ u . s. joint communique in shanghai , the carter administration finally accepted china 's stance on the taiwan issue and the two countries successfully established diplomatic relation . 
this event and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to u.s. started a new chapter in sino @-@ u . s. relation . 
when reagan first assumed office , china and u.s. had some intense arguments about the taiwan problem . 
after difficult negotiations , the two governments announced the " august 17 " communique in 1982 and agreed to solve the taiwan weapon sales problem by steps . 
the shanghai communique , sino @-@ u . s. diplomatic relation communique and the " august 17 " communique have collectively formed the political foundation for sino @-@ u . s. relation . 
after the establishment of diplomatic relation for 10 years , the overall sino @-@ u . s. relation is stable notwithstanding the two countries still have some struggle over the taiwan issue from time to time . association and cooperation in many areas are increasing day by day . 
in the eighties and early nineties of the twentieth century , dramatic changes took place in eastern europe . on disintegration of soviet union and ending of the cold war , international situation has taken the greatest change since world war ii . 
u.s. took the lead to sanction china and announced the sale of 150 f @-@ 16 fighters to taiwan . u.s. linked the human right issue with the most favored nation status and allowed lee teng @-@ hui to visit america . the sino @-@ u . s. relation sank to a low point . 
as china 's economy started to grow rapidly , china 's international position has risen gradually . 
more and more americans began to recognize the improvement and development of sino @-@ u . s. relation is in the fundamental interest of united states and china . 
as expected , malaysia prime minister abdullah dissolved parliament the day before yesterday and the election for a new government will be held in the near future . 
abdullah took over the leadership from mahathir in november last year , in other words , only four months ago . 
notwithstanding that , he still decided to dissolve parliament and advance the date of the poll . 
without doubt , abdullah 's decision to hold a lightning election reflects that he has already completed a comprehensive assessment of the political situation in malaysia . 
the current economic situation in malaysia is quite good and it is not likely that the opposition can use this topic to attack the government . 
meanwhile , he has urged to improve the efficiency in civil services , which is another move that inspired people . 
( international ) u.s. rescue team does not talk politics in iran 
catlin pointed out the u.s. rescue team has " nothing to do with politics " . in fact , u.s. has provided similar humanitarian aids to iran . 
he said the u.s. team has 81 members . the team has set up a city search group and a military hospital in bam area . several smaller units are responsible to go into the city to assess the damage to houses . 
they have brought relief resources including plastic sheets and tents etc. 
when catlin was asked about how long the rescue team would stay in bam , he said , " we will stay here as long as the host ( iran government ) let us stay . " 
catlin also said the u.s. rescue team is completely free to move around in bam . there is no iran police to follow them or protect them . 
furthermore , he believed that iran government 's disaster response and management capability is " first class and outstanding " . 
u.s. agency for international development is an institution under u.s. international development cooperation agency . both are under the jurisdiction of the state department . 
u.s. and iran terminated their diplomatic relation in 1980 and have never resumed normal relation since then . 
u.s. still regards iran as a " supporter of terrorism " and part of the " axis of evil " . 
in response to the request for actions by iran 's ambassador to united nations , u.s. has sent the rescue team to iran . 
nevertheless , past challenges are not limited to subsidized public housing . private housing is also full of serious ordeals . 
the outbreak of 1997 financial crisis has burst the asset bubble , causing property price to fall by 70 percent . property owners are hard hit , which was actually the main cause for the accelerated deflation in the past five years . 
the economy is turning good now and we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure steady development in our property market . 
a healthy property market is indeed important to a full recovery in hong kong economy . 
we are also committed to protect and improve our living environment . 
our work down the road is based on the principle of sustainable development . we will adopt better city planning and strengthen the protection of natural scenery and cultural relics in order to improve our living environment . 
we will double our attention to environmental problems . 
in last year , the sudden outbreak of " sars " reminds us that we must create spacious , clean and healthy living environment . 
we have to put in more efforts to beautify our environment -- plant more trees , build more parks and recreation facilities for the enjoyment of our citizens . 
education is the cornerstone of modern civilization . 
to improve the quality of our nationals and to strengthen the overall national power , we must put in great efforts to develop education . 
education in rural villages has extensive influence and is affecting the overall economic development in both rural villages and our society . 
since the reform and opening , the appearance of cities and villages in our nation has gone through substantial and profound changes . this has a close connection with education , especially education in rural villages . 
after rural villages implemented the household contract responsibility system , productivity has been greatly enhanced . 
the technology revolution in the world and our migration towards a full @-@ scale fairly prosperous society have imposed higher demands on the general rural population in terms of their scientific , cultural , ideological and moral quality . 
without the " 9 @-@ year universal mandatory education " , there cannot be any all @-@ round quality improvement for peasants and it would be difficult to realize a fairly prosperous society . 
we must fully recognize the function of rural education , including its foundation effect , leading nature and its overall role in the development of a full @-@ scale fairly prosperous society . 
to govern is not to enjoy power , but rather to embrace responsibility . 
for a long time , the democratic progressive party acted as the " government 's delegate " in efforts to expand taiwan 's diplomacy and has attained admirable results . 
next march , i will formally assume the chair of the " council on asian liberals and democrats " . i hope to use the position as a leader of an international organization to find more opportunities for taiwan to contribute to the international community . 
in addition , the democratic progressive party has actively participated in the activities of the " liberal international " since it became a formal member last year . 
apart from sending a human rights commissioner to be stationed at the secretariat of liberal international 's london headquarters , we will cooperate with other member parties on political reform forums to be held in various locations in central america , south america and europe etc. 
health checks for drivers entering and leaving shenzhen 
the bureau appealed to all relevant units and driver crossing the border for positive cooperation in order to perfect this job . public health can only be protected when solid measures are taken to prevent the transmission of sars into and out of the shenzhen ports . 
the three sides have exchanged views candidly and the discussion involved politics , humanity and security issues in iraq as well as the appointment of a special un representative to be stationed in iraq . 
u.s. -@ britain is at a critical juncture where their plan to transfer power in iraq might be boycotted . as a result , people are watching attentively whether and how un may involve in the reconstruction of iraq . 
since u.s. announced that the main war in iraq has ended in early may last year , the situation in iraq continues to be unstable . attacks came one after the other as protests against the occupation and are causing countless casualties to the u.s. -@ britain coalition . there is hardly any peaceful day . 
the former president of iraq , saddem hussein , was captured on december 13 last year but the joy in u.s. failed to endure . the security situation in iraq has not improved . resistance activities have intensified and are pushing the occupying forces into a difficulty position . 
on the other hand , the people of iraq and arab countries have unanimously demanded foreign troops to leave and return sovereignty to iraq , thus allowing the people of iraq to manage their own country . 
meanwhile , u.s. and britain are making every effort to re @-@ mold the iraq regime according to their wishes because on such a foundation , they can gradually extricate themselves from this quagmire " in an elegant way " . 
for this purpose , the process and the model of power transfer have become the focus of iraq affairs at this time . 
iraq 's shiite , which accounts for the majority of the population , stressed that a nationwide direct election is the fair way to return sovereignty to iraq . 
u.s. to release hundreds of iraqi prisoners 
pachachi praised the coalition for adopting the aforesaid policy and said that was the result of the governing council 's lobbying effort . 
" the governing council has been promoting a peaceful reconciliation amongst all citizens of iraq for a long time . in order to achieve this objective , we have demanded the coalition to review the problem of prisoners , " pachachi told reporters . 
a coalition spokesman who declined to be named said later that a total of 506 detainees would be released in the next couple of weeks . 
" the coalition will release the first batch of 100 detainees tomorrow , " bremer said in his short speech to reporters . 
bremer is making a peace gesture at a time when the coalition strives to comfort and reduce accumulated hatred in saddam 's tribe , the islamic sunnites community . 
hussein was captured alive by u.s. troops after fleeing and hiding for eight months . 
" as the tyrant is now a prisoner and the majority of his gang are either dead or captured , it is now the time for a reconciliation , " bremer said . 
the condition for a release is that the prisoner " must renounce violence " and have a guarantor , such as a prominent person in his community or a religious or tribal leader , who will accept responsibility for the good conduct of the individual being freed . 
bremer pointed out that all prisoners to be freed had never directly involved in any attack on the u.s. army or any other fatal attacks and were never involved in criminal activities or crimes against humanity . 
bremer said those to be released " made a mistake but have now waken up to reality " and " we are prepared to give some of them a chance to make a fresh start " . 
burundian president : ex @-@ rebels to join army 's leadership 
the former rebel , " forces for the defense of democracy " ( fdd ) , welcomed the move and applauded it as a " crucial step " in the creation of new armed forces . 
" all parties that signed the ( november 2003 ceasefire ) accord should finish the cantoning of their fighters by january 5 , 2004 , at the latest , " ndayizeye said . 
he also said the integration of ex @-@ rebels in the chief of staff should be put in place before january 7 . 
the exercise mainly concerns the fdd , the largest of the six rebel movements that signed the accord . 
the seventh rebel movement , the " national liberation forces " , has refused to sign the peace accord . 
burundi 's civil war between hutu rebels and tutsi government troops has claimed some 300,000 lives since 1993 . 
recently , the public opinions in europe are exploring a popular topic -- is the meeting of the " three magnates " , german chancellor schroeder , french president chirac and british prime minister blair , gradually becomes some kind of mechanism ? 
public opinions called the " three magnates " the " three new carts " of european union and the relation between the three countries as the " new triangle " . 
a review of european history for the past hundred years tells us a fundamental characteristic of the triangular relation between germany , france and britain : the alliance of britain and france to restrict or resist germany . 
the two world wars are the proof . 
during the cold war , east and west germany were separated as a member in the warsaw pact and the north atlantic treaty organization respectively . 
in recent years , the " germany @-@ france axle " has fired up again but the drastic clashes between unilateralism and multi @-@ polarization in the world has pushed european union into a serious spilt on the iraq issue : 
the " old europe " led by germany , france and the " new europe " led by britain , poland adopted totally opposite stands in the iraq war problem . 
it also happened that the spilt occurred at a time when the european union was about to proceed with the biggest enlargement in history . 
asia has a time @-@ honored and glorious culture . the valleys of yellow river , yangtze river , indus river , ganges river , the euphrates and the tigris are all known as cradles of human civilization . 
in its lengthy progress through history , the people of asia have composed resplendent pages and chapters on human civilization development . 
in recent generations , asia has experienced many suffering and vicissitudes of life . the people of different nations strived for liberation , sought development and made untiring efforts before asia attained some enormous achievements . 
but , to realize a new up @-@ rise and revitalization of asia , there is still a long way to go . 
asia needs better cooperation and should encourage development in order to achieve a win @-@ win situation . this is the only route to a new up @-@ rise and revitalization of asia , which is also in the fundamental interest of all people in asia . 
given new situations in the new century , asian developments are facing new opportunities . 
peace and development is still theme of our era . an overall peaceful environment among nations has provided a favorable external condition for asian development . 
asia has abundant resources and possesses a vast market . it is also a region with the best economic vitality in our world . its development potential is huge .

( agence france @-@ presse , washington , 22 nd ) - the officials of united states national aeronautics and space administration ( nasa ) said today nasa has lost contact with the landed " spirit " because of a serious breakdown in the rover vehicle . 
" we have discovered a serious anomaly on the rover vehicle , " said theisinger , officer @-@ in @-@ charge of the mars exploration rover mission .

spirit arrived mars on january 3 and started searching for signs of life on the red planet last week . 
spirit 's twin rover , the " opportunity " , is scheduled to land at nighttime between january 24 and january 25 . 
the 820 million dollar exploration mission expects the two solar powered rovers to keep working for about three months .

xinhua news agency , london , january 9 - tennis player rusedski admitted failing a drugs test on the 9 th . however , he claimed that many tennis players use stimulants and he was just chosen as the scapegoat by the association of tennis professionals ( atp ) .

the 30 @-@ year @-@ old greg rusedski said , " i have been singled out . this is wrong , unfair and discriminatory . 
they should not prosecute me . they need to do a thorough investigation of the whole matter . " 
rusedski swore that he would " fight this injustice to the end " . 
he insisted that he did not use any banned drugs to enhance performance .

an old arab proverb says , " a thousand years of tyranny being better than one day of anarchy " . 
is this what is worrying the countries in northeastern asia ? 
i think the answer is probably yes . 
the focus of the study is the position adopted by different countries to these strategies . 
furthermore , the study also tries to analyze the threat imposed by north korea 's nuclear weapon plan according to people 's fear in neighboring countries , their belief of a probably nuclear attack and the possible damage . 
china and russia feel that the danger of north korea using its nuclear weapon is low or very low but the people of japan and south korea believe the threat is rather high . 
all northeastern countries in asia are in favor of maintaining a relation with north korea . 
japan supports stonewalling and some other countries also accept the strategy of stonewalling under some specific situation . 
i know the legislative council started discussions with the government regarding a long @-@ term office location for the legislative council ten years ago . 
similarly , the government has been considering a long @-@ term plan to relocate the central government offices for more than ten years . 
therefore , i understand that some members of the legislative council will definitely be disappointed by the government 's decision to postpone the tamar development project , which includes the new legislative council complex . 
i can understand that it is really great inconveniences for members of the legislative council to continue to work in less @-@ than @-@ desired environment during this period of time . 
however , just like what i told the colleagues in the government , who are equally affected by this decision , i hope everyone would put public interest as the major premise , understand the situation , and be patient during this period of time . 
the government is to postpone the new legislative council complex situated at tamar site . this can help reduce the financial strain to the government in the next few years . it is also in the interest of the public and will be accepted by the public . 
the government will re @-@ commence the development project of the tamar site and the new legislative council complex when the status of public finance improves . our existing plan is to do so . 
as the largest debtor country in the world , united states ' foreign debt is on the rise again . 
u.s. treasury department announced on january 16 that the country owes a total of 6.494 trillion u.s. dollars to all kinds of foreign creditors , 2.2 percent higher than the previous announcement . 
on average , every american shares a debt of over twenty thousand u.s. dollars . 
statistics show that foreign private investors are holding some 40 percent of all u.s. government bonds . 
this reminds us the idea presented by keynes to president roosevelt in the first half of the 20 th century -- adopt a deficit policy to stimulate economy at home and borrow money from other countries to make up for the shortfall . 
the measure did play an important role to stimulate " effective demand " and could ease a financial crisis as pressing as a fire singeing one 's eyebrows . 
however , people can see many american administrations followed the same measure and taken it as a " miraculous cure " . 
since president reagan called for tax cut and arms expansion in the eighties of the twentieth century , u.s. fiscal deficits are increasing gradually and eventually turned u.s. into the biggest debtor nation .

the peace hope in south asia subcontinent has risen again as pakistani and indian officials held talks on february 16 - 18 in islamabad . 
before this talk , many analysts are still very conservative about the future of the peace process , despite a series of good intentions exhibited by both sides have already warmed up their relation . 
first , the timetable agreed in the meeting is feasible and both sides have not only confirmed the specific schedule and topics for meeting but also assigned levels to different talks in accordance with the importance of the topic involved . 
during the saarc summit , the bilateral meeting of indian prime minister vajpayee and pakistani president musharraf was especially conspicuous . 
in the last summit , vajpayee and musharraf shook their hands but that did not give people too much hope to the relation development between the two countries . 
the two countries have taken another stride forward in the process of improving their bilateral relation , which is a favorable turn for cooperation in south asia region . 
notwithstanding india 's foreign minister sinha said on the 4 th that the meeting was of " ceremonial nature " , most people believe the meeting means india and pakistan relation is heading for a more positive and practical direction . 
the leaders of both countries have recognized that tensions and hostility are not in the interests of their nations . on the other hand , they are missing economic development opportunities time after time . 
as globalization intensifies , the urgent tasks of the two governments are to revive their economies and strengthen their cooperation .

( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet 
xinhua news agency , ram allah , feb. 9 ( international observation ) hamas seeks breakthrough in forming cabinet 
xinhua news agency correspondents wang hao and huang min 
after the palestinian islamic resistance movement ( hamas ) won the legislative council elections , how to draw up a blueprint for a new government has become the current focus of international attention . 
what new policies hamas will push for will directly impact the direction of subsequent corresponding policies by the various parties to the peace process . 
in the meantime , resistance by the us and israel will add to the uncertainty about the prospects of the hamas government . 
at present , various parties in palestine are accelerating consultations and actively seeking breakthroughs on difficulties and sensitive points regarding future developments involved in forming the cabinet . 
( subtitle ) who will become prime minister ? 
after hamas obtained the right to form the cabinet , some outsiders worried that disagreements could occur between " prime minister hamas " and current top leader abbas . 
in addition , hamas leader mashal , who is currently visiting egypt , stressed that the new palestinian government led and formed by hamas will not recognize israel . this strong message also increased international concern . 
the us and israel explicitly said that they would not accept a hamas government which possesses actual power , threatening to discontinue economic aid and tax transfers to palestine . 
however , this did not hinder hamas from making a flexible tactical adjustment , selecting an independent individual as a compromise . 
according to reports , in order to obtain maximum international recognition , hamas leaders both at home and abroad , who recently gathered in egypt , decided to select independent jamal al @-@ khudairi , board chairman of the islamic university in gaza , as new prime minister . 
the move has yet to receive responses from relevant parties . 
palestinian analyst hussein said that no matter who becomes prime minister , the key is that the prime minister nominee should try to downplay the hard @-@ line stance of hamas . only in this way can success in forming a cabinet be ensured . 
( subtitle ) how to divide power ? 
internally , the biggest challenge hamas faces in forming a cabinet is its lack of sufficient experience in governance . 
following the elections , hamas proposed establishing a " political partnership " with fatah so as to jointly form a national coalition government . however , fatah has not responded enthusiastically so far . 
fatah is currently divided internally with regards to joining the cabinet . one faction advocates joining the new government so as to make some kind of move , while another faction rejects the hamas invitation , preferring to be an " active opposition " in the legislative council . 
sources noted that under abbas 's persuasion , fatah is gradually leaning toward joining the new government . 
in spite of this , hamas and fatah will still bargain over the distribution of cabinet positions . 
in addition , another approach is to form a cabinet outside the framework of the legislative council , breaking away from partisan affiliations . 
according to reports , hamas has designed a government exclusively composed of experts , but the specific name list is unknown . 
based on us and israeli attitudes , forming a government composed of technical experts would also be a good way to relieve outside pressure . 
according to the provisions of the palestinian basic law , after the new legislative council assumes power on the 16 th of this month , the nomination of the prime minister and formation of the cabinet will be completed within three to five weeks . 
( subtitle ) what about arms ? 
the weapons it possesses is another tough issue hamas faces in forming the new government . 
the us and israel are very firm in their positions , resolutely demanding that hamas abandon violence and rejecting its armed participation in the government . 
hamas leader mashal stressed on the 9 th that armed resistance is a " strategic choice " of the organization . 
the issue of weapons actually exists on two levels , the legitimacy of arms and the affiliation and administration of armed forces . 
hamas had previously proposed unifying armed forces of all factions into a " people 's army " of the palestinian national authority , yet failed to get widespread response and was criticized by the palestinian islamic jihad ( jihad ) . 
at present , palestine has more than 60,000 security agency personnel , most of whom come from the fatah camp . 
in addition , fatah has some loosely organized subordinate armed factions , such as al @-@ aqsa martyrs ' brigades and the fatah hawks . 
hamas , which is responsible for forming the cabinet , must reach a consensus with abbas as to how to manage these autonomous armed forces and reasonably divide administrative power . 
according to local media reports , abbas intends to be in charge of security and intelligence forces , while leaving agencies such as the police and civil defense under the administration of the interior ministry of the new government . 
however , the various parties are still negotiating over this sensitive issue , with no outcome so far .

the recently concluded " super bowl " american football game has warmed up the us broadcasting business to welcome the age of hdtv . 
according to a financial times report the other day , the us congress recently passed a bill requiring that american broadcasters must discontinue all current analog tv signal broadcasting and only broadcast digital tv signals by february 17 , 2009 . 
this means that the full digitization of us television programs now has a clear timetable . 
in order for hdtv to become widespread , it must on one hand depend on consumers to purchase tv sets , and on the other depend on the content industry to supply high @-@ definition digital programs . 
although digital tv has been brought up repeatedly in the past few years , it has still not become reality . 
the issue has taken a new turn this year . 
according to the us consumer electronics association , this year digital tv sales in the us passed that of conventional tv for the first time , and 85 % of the digital tvs were high @-@ definition products .

south african minister plenipotentiary in china says no " organized " crimes against chinese citizens in south africa 
at the same time , he said that the south african government will try its best to " crack down on all forms of criminal activity . " 
vusi b. koloane said that the south african government hopes to " reduce to zero " the crime rate and hopes that the life and property of every foreign national working in south africa will be fully protected by the local law and citizens . 
since 2006 , four chinese citizens have already been killed one after another in south africa . chinese communities have shown widespread concern about this . 
in response to this , the chinese foreign ministry has made representations to south africa and also reminded chinese citizens in south africa to further step up vigilance , enhance unity and friendship among chinese compatriots , and cooperate with police to jointly combat crime activities . 
" we express our sincerest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims . " 
vusi b. koloane said : " we apologize for this and assure the chinese people that the south african government is earnestly investigating every single case involving chinese nationals . " 
according to the chinese embassy in south africa , south african police have successfully cracked the february 5 case in which chen jianqing , a chinese woman from fujian , china , was killed in south africa . a suspect has been arrested . 
at present police are after another suspect . 
also , according to the disclosure by the south african embassy in china , the criminal involved in the shooting of a hong kong businessman in january of this year has been arrested by south african police , with the property of the victim recovered . 
according to the briefing by nyembezi , tourism attache of the south african embassy , the embassy issued more than 2,000 visas to chinese nationals going to south africa in the first 15 days alone of this year . 
in addition , according to the chinese official statistics , south africa continued to maintain its position as china 's largest trade partner in africa in 2005 . 
the bilateral trade volume reached 7.27 billion us dollars , growing 23 % year @-@ on @-@ year . 
however , tourism professionals think that the serial killings of chinese citizens in 2004 have significantly affected the number of chinese tourists to south africa . 
according to the statistics of south africa 's tourism bureau , the number of chinese tourists to south africa in the first half of 2005 was 20,331 , a 14.9 % year @-@ on @-@ year decrease . 
currently , some 200,000 chinese nationals live in towns and rural areas across south africa . 
analysts here attribute the high crime rate to the large gap between the rich and the poor , high unemployment rate , rampant use of guns , and lack of death penalty in south africa . 
as many chinese nationals do not understand english and have cash with them or in their homes , they are more likely to become targets of attack by criminals seeking their money .
